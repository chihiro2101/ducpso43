On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included selections from his ``Mass'' and ``Chichester Psalms''
Wednesday's midday concert at Carnegie Hall also came on the 90th birthday of the late composer-conductor's close friend Aaron Copland
The concert began with selections from Bernstein's ``Mass'' which he composed for the opening of the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington and ended with Psalm 133 in Hebrew from Bernstein's ``Chichester Psalms''
Singers were the Westminster Choir mezzo-sopranos Marilyn Horne and Christa Ludwig soprano Clamma Dale tenor Jerry Hadley and baritones Thomas Hampson and Chester Ludgin
