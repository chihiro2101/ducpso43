DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation one of their own public companies have been obtained by the Financial Times
Meanwhile a director of a secretive Swiss trust Mr Werner Rechsteiner has broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of MCC shares to his trust which are at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office were made on the instructions of Robert Maxwell
This is the first time that Mr Rechsteiner has given details of the relationship between his mysterious trust Yakosa Finanzierungs and the Maxwell family
The FT has also obtained a letter and has seen a corroborating fax which shows that Mr Kevin Maxwell was intimately involved in the purchase of 9m shares by Yakosa and a further 16m shares by Servex another Swiss Trust
The MCC purchases by Yakosa and Servex are the object of an investigation by the SFO into an alleged illegal scheme to support the MCC share price
The SFO is also investigating whether Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases of the shares by the Swiss trusts
The documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust a private UK company controlled by the Maxwell family provided Pounds 5533m on behalf of the two Swiss trusts so that they could pay for the MCC shares
The Swiss trusts bought the shares using Goldman as broker from two Maxwell pension funds Maxwell Communication Pension Trustee (Works Scheme) and Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Trustee (Works Scheme)
