The Oscar statuette one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment world has no copyright protection a federal judge has ruled
The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain US District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said in a ruling released Thursday
The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar
Although Waters acknowledged that the Creative House trophy is ``very similar'' to the Oscar he rejected all of the academy's legal claims saying that the statuette became part of the public domain prior to Jan 1 1978 the effective date of the Copyright Act of 1976
