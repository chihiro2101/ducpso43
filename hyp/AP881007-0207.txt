``I believe in fairies the myths dragons
It all exists even if it's in your mind
Who's to say that dreams and nightmares aren't as real as the here and now
Reality leaves a lot to the imagination''
Watching the new movie ``Imagine John Lennon'' was very painful for the late Beatle's wife Yoko Ono
``The only reason why I did watch it to the end is because I'm responsible for it even though somebody else made it'' she said
Cassettes film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie were collected by Ono
She also took cassettes of interviews by Lennon which were edited in such a way that he narrates the picture
This Is Elvis'') directed Solt and David L Wolper produced and Solt and Sam Egan wrote it
``I think this is really the definitive documentary of John Lennon's life'' Ono said in an interview
``What John was really about is depicted in this film very accurately and without whitewashing
In the sense you had to put a 40-year life into an hour and a half balance is a very serious consideration
I think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so''
There is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments primarily by Lennon tied in with the film and using the same title

Ono said Lennon wrote the song ``Imagine'' in 1969 or '70
``We did the bed-in the Toronto Peace Festival the `War's Over' billboard
He was saying we need an anthem for this whole concept of world peace
I think it's one of the songs that will really go on forever in people's minds''
She later joined him in music and in public demonstrations for peace
Lennon's half sister Julia Baird also has written a new book ``John Lennon My Brother''
She has no idea how many books have been written about Lennon she's been sent some of them but hasn't read them
And there's another big John Lennon project on her horizon
They might become a record might eventually become a musical
