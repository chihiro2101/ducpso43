Bob Hope keeps voluminous files including the jokes he delivered and people he has performed with and his first entry under Lucille Ball is an appearance with Hope in 1945 on a show called ``GI Journal''
``I really can't remember many details about it'' said Hope who pays tribute to his frequent co-star in an NBC special Saturday night
It's called ``Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucille Ball''
That first time together was followed by four movies frequent visits by Hope on ``I Love Lucy'' and regular appearances by Lucy on his television shows
``Lucy was a very funny woman'' Hope said
``Even in private she could get off a great ad lib

``Someone reminded me the other night of a bus tour we did of movie theaters in New York to promote one our of pictures'' he said
