The death of Emperor Hirohito finished the list of political and military leaders of the World War II era one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of history on either the European or Asian continents
The political and military role that Emperor Hirohito played before and during the war was never clear to us
At the surrender of the Imperial Japanese government Hirohito was spared punishment because "it was his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors"
I only wish that the soul of Emperor Hirohito be ready to face the ultimate justice when he meets with the waiting souls of millions of innocent men women and children who were tortured and murdered in his name during the war
