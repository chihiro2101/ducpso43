An explosion today flattened a military barracks and tore through nearby homes killing 11 people and injuring 22 police said
The IRA claimed responsibility for the blast
More than 100 rescue workers frantically dug through the rubble of a three-story building that collapsed at the Royal Marines School of Music near Deal
Chief Police Inspector Alan Butterfield of Kent who who provided the casualty figures and coordinated the rescue effort first reported that one person was missing but later said everyone was accounted for
Defense Secretary Tom King inspecting the wreckage said ``It is not yet absolutely confirmed that it is a bomb but all the evidence is quite clearly that this is an IRA atrocity''
British military installations are a frequent bombing target of the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule but today's explosion in the coastal town 70 miles southeast of London was the worst IRA attack on the British mainland in more than seven years
Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to search through the debris said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin Simmons
A statement telephoned to Ireland International a Dublin news agency said ``we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent'' in response to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Northern Ireland nine days ago
It was signed P O'Neill a nom de guerre the IRA usually uses to claim responsibility for actions outside Northern Ireland
Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey issued a statement in Dublin condemning the attack calling it an ``outrage''
The last IRA bomb attempt on the British mainland was in February when about 60 soldiers were evacuated from their barracks in Shropshire western England just before a bomb exploded
In July 1982 eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the Household Cavalry barracks in central London and at a bandstand in the capital's Regent's Park where an army band was playing
Mrs Minnock's next-door neighbor Heather Hackett said she was standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks at the time of the explosion
