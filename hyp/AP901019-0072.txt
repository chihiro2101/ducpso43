For the New York Philharmonic it was supposed to be a night of Beethoven and Shostakovich
The fates made it a night of Leonard Bernstein
The official catalog of his works says Bernstein led 74 orchestras
But this was HIS orchestra and the musicians came to pay tribute to THEIR laureate conductor who led them through 1244 concerts during his 47-year association with the Philharmonic
They let his music do the talking
Also added were his ``Chichester Psalms'' (1965) and his overture to ``Candide'' (1956)
The substitute Bernstein program was being repeated Friday night Saturday and Tuesday
Slatkin's brief introductory comments followed by the whimsical ``Candide'' broke some of the tension
Then came the eclectic ``Serenade'' which Bernstein's program notes says is supposed to be based on Plato's ``Symposium''
During her chanting of the prophet's ``Lamentations'' mezzo-soprano Wendy White had to wipe a tear from her eye
The New York Choral Artists and a boy soloist joined the orchestra
