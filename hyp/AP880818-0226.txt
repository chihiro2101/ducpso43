Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen Dan Quayle of Indiana for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night
Mr Chairman four of my congressional colleagues and I are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the United States
We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the Republican Party a man I am proud to say is my colleague the junior senator from Indiana Dan Quayle
You know senators get a lot of mail
And almost every one of these letters asks for help with some problem
Well three years ago I received a handwritten plea from a 6-year-old girl who after several days of long long Senate sessions had a very special problem
I knew Corinne Quayle was from a political family because she invited me to come along too
Corinne and her brothers Tucker and Benjamin and their mother Marilyn share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United States Senate
Whether it was the budget or defense tax reform or the INF treaty Dan Quayle was there a forceful advocate and a staunch supporter of the Reagan revolution
