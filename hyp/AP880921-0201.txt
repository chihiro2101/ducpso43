When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began digging into ``The Lives of John Lennon'' his first move was to mail a long reverential request for help to Yoko Ono
``She was Numero Uno you've got to start with her
I sent her a sincere letter because at that time I was a true believer in rock's greatest love story
And after 1200 interviews and 6{ years the dream was over for Goldman his mythic view of Lennon the Great altered
Expecting the best Goldman claims to have uncovered the worst a volatile debauched Lennon who evolved into the Howard Hughes of rock 'n' roll tucked in his Dakota bed for days at a time
That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing it also taught Goldman _ who says he is a John Lennon fan _ a hard lesson
Goldman whose past tell-all biographies dealt with Elvis Presley and Lenny Bruce remains unmoved by the hue and cry from the music industry from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy Paul McCartney
``My books are bad for business'' Goldman said in a phone interview from Munich West Germany
``They're bad for Paul's business bad for Yoko's business back for the jive myth of rock business
Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono McCartney Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defame because he's no longer around to answer the allegations
Those attacks don't really bother him unless they come from someone who hasn't read ``The Lives of John Lennon'' Goldman said
She labeled Goldman's version of life with the Lennons ``totally fiction'' and brought out Lennon's sons Julian and 12-year-old Sean to refute the biography
As for the sensational charges of bisexuality drug abuse by Yoko and John wild drinking binges anorexia and reclusiveness Goldman says it all fits together with the image of Lennon presented by those who knew him
