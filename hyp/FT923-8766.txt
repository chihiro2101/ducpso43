TOMORROW evening just before the Olympic closing ceremony the last and one of the most prestigious events of the Games will be held
It is also without doubt the most gruelling
Run in high heat high humidity high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course the Barcelona Olympic men's marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run
It is estimated that when the race begins in Mataro a seaside town north of Barcelona the temperature will be an already-uncomfortable 25`C Towards the marathon's end however radiant heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a temperature of up to 30`C
More debilitating still relative humidity in Barcelona in August rises as high as 80 per cent

I spoke to Britain's Steve Brace winner of the Paris marathon in 1989 and 1990 the Berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the Barcelona event
The winner of the London marathon earns a tidy Dollars 50000 and the New York Boston and Japanese runs are all in the same prize-winning category
