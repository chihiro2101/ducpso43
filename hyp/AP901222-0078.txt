Chief Petty Officer Lance Vickery recalls waves tumbling into the stern of the bobbing ferry headed back to the USS Saratoga and joking ``Whoa looks like we're flooding''
Only minutes later his words came true turning a simple ride back from Christmas shore leave into a harrowing fight to survive
The Israeli ferry Tuvia capsized shortly after midnight on Saturday throwing more than 100 men into the cold waters of Haifa Bay
The sailors were part of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq
Vickery 33 was among four American sailors interviewed at Haifa's Rambam Hospital
He is from Jacksonville Fla is not far from Mayport the Saragota's home port
Three of the sailors said the boat had been taking on water over the stern in heavy seas then capsized when it was hit by a big wave
``So they just dragged us through the water back to the Saratoga and I was a real happy person to see those guys snatching me up'' he said
As Vickery was being treated for bleeding lungs caused by water inhalation his hospital roommate Seaman Michael Benjamin 19 of San Antonio Texas was recovering from a neck injury suffered when a rescue boat hit him while he was in the water
Both were wearing blue hospital pajamas and when they walked to the visiting room's balcony could see the Saratoga anchored outside the Haifa harbor
Two other men interviewed at Rambam Hospital identified themselves as Technician John Richards 31 of Twin Lake Mich and Airman Lamont Jones 20 of Claremont Va
