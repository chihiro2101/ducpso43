COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley who spearheaded violent anti-reform rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991 are once again out on strike pressing the government for higher wages
But so far the government unlike its predecessors has not caved in
It has instead begun legal action to have the strike which today entered its second week declared illegal
Romanians appear solidly opposed to the strike angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of the equivalent of Dollars 290 a month
The Ministry of Industry argues that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produced each year in the Jiu Valley's 13 mines is not a vital source of energy
They are also following the call of their charismatic leader Mr Miron Cosma the man who led them on protests to Bucharest and secured their earlier wage increases
In recent months Mr Cosma has claimed he has evidence that senior government officials including President Ion Iliescu called miners to Bucharest as part of plans to consolidate their own power
