Free enterprise has collided with the Academy Awards and everybody's trying to pick up the pieces
With Oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than $10000 and a Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is scrambling to make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished by Hollywood hucksterism
``If you know about an infringement and fail to object to it you risk having your trademark become public domain'' said Bruce Davis the Academy's executive administrator in explaining the lawsuits the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of electroplated pewter
But despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism this year's awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising wrinkle Some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to the Oscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted coolers jammed with Diet Coke Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co beverages
When the limo doors swing open in front of the Shrine Auditorium and the celebrities tumble out the Coke logo will be on display in front of an audience that includes millions around the world
When MGM-UA the distributor of ``Rain Man'' published newspaper advertisements touting the film's Oscar nominations before the nominations were even announced the Academy issued a harsh statement condemning MGM-UA's promotional gamble
The Collector's Book Store local sponsors of monthly entertainment memorabilia auctions has sold off seven Oscars in the past year including the best picture trophy for 1951's ``An American in Paris'' ($15760) Marlon Brando's best actor prize for 1954's ``On the Waterfront'' ($13000) and the black and white interior decoration Oscar for 1941's ``How Green Was My Valley'' ($17715)
When Malcolm Willits the book store's owner announced that he would hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy for ``Around the World in 80 Days'' the Academy said enough initiating a court action that for now has blocked any future trophy sales
Yet the Academy has lost its most recent attempt to save its trophy's integrity A copyright infringement suit brought against the Houston International Film Festival was dismissed March 16 in a California federal court
