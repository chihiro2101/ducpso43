US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage
The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century
In the Bahamas government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands
Mr Justin Balcombe of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account
That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 21bn-Pounds 31bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane Hugo which hit South Carolina in 1989
Mr George Lloyd-Roberts chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association said that unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact
Among other UK insurers Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each
