The hurricane killed at least five people Sunday in the Dominican Republic civil defense officials said
Six people died and 60000 were left homeless in Jamaica on Monday officials there said
Prime Minister Edward Seaga said the hurricane swept the full length of Jamaica ``leaving a trail of wreckage behind it''
``It will take us some time before we can assess the full damage without any doubt''
``But I have no doubt that this going to be the worst disaster that we have experienced in our modern history''
Communications were down with many storm-ravaged areas and the death toll was expected to rise with the arrival of damage and casualty reports

Bob Sheets director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables Fla described Gilbert as ``a great hurricane  in the top 10 percent (historically) as far as intensity size and destructive potential''
Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ a 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people
``The people who need to be concerned now are those people over on the Yucatan Peninsula _ Cancun Cozumel that whole area'' Sheets said
