But the highlight of the new season is the celebration of Bernstein's birthday
When Koussevitzky retired in 1949 he tried to have the young Bernstein named as his successor but the BSO's trustees chose Charles Munch because they considered Bernstein too young and tainted by popular music
The following night Ozawa and special guests will appear in a Music Shed concert for a performance intended to show Bernstein's influence on other musicians
All proceeds go to the music center's endowment fund and to a fund Bernstein established for aspiring young conductors
Events climax in 1990 with observances marking the 50th year of the music center the festival's school
