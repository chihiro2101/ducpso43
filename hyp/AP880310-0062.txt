With no seats and no food for the guests of honor everyone agreed that lunch at Sardi's had gone to the dogs
The Dog Fanciers Club organized the event Wednesday to honor Champion Great Elms Prince Charming II a fluffy little Pomeranian and Nero a big amiable bruiser of a German shepherd
The Pomeranian was named best in show at the prestigious Westminister Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden last month
But neither Nero nor Prince got any lunch from the luncheon at Sardi's a prominent midtown Manhattan restaurant
