Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life He was to play on John Lennon's new album
Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years busy taking care of his son Sean and admittedly out of songwriting ideas
But in 1980 he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to the studio to make an album with his wife Yoko Ono
Afterall Lennon gave no press conferences and didn't attend clubs or concerts
Rare photos occasionally emerged and he looked different in each one (Lennon jokingly referred to himself as ``Greta Hughes'' and ``Howard Garbo'')
Producer Jack Douglas who had worked with Lennon as an engineer recruited Newmark bassist Tony Levin guitarist Hugh McCracken and other New York-based sessions players
Recording was to take place at the Hit Factory in Manhattan
The drummer guessed he was something like the intense irreverent young man of the movies ``Help''
``His personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever heard about John Lennon'' said Newmark who still lives in New York and works with former Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry
It just appeared to be what we had imagined down to earth direct so direct it could not offend people''
Newmark spent just one month in the studio playing on the songs that eventually ended up on ``Double Fantasy'' and ``Milk and Honey'' Lennon's final albums
Lennon defended his self-imposed retirement on ``Watching the Wheels'' and summed up his feelings about turning 40 on ``Borrowed Time'' capping the line ``Good to be older'' with a self-assured ``you bet''
Between takes Lennon jammed on Buddy Holly songs and played host
By the fall Newmark had finished working on the album and his contact with Lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the studio
``Milk and Honey'' was to come out the following year and Lennon wanted to tour using many of the same musicians
