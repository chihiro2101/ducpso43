World leaders from President Reagan to Malaysia's king mourned today's death of Emperor Hirohito who surrendered a broken nation to the Allies in World War II but presided over its rise to economic pre-eminence
Reaction to Hirohito's death at age 87 however was decidedly cool in several Asian countries including South Korea which endured years of harsh colonial rule by Japan
While South Korea President Roh Tae-Woo sent his condolences a government party statement added ``We reserve further comment considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japan relationship''
The main opposition party led by Kim Dae-jung said ``We have complex feelings at the death of Hirohito in view of Japan's 20-year rule over Korea during his reign''
A leading newspaper in Seoul The Joong-Ang Daily News wrote that Hirohito's death ``reminds all the Korean people of a disgraced period and  humiliation
Hirohito is the symbolic figure who must assume most and final responsibility for (Japan's) preposterous crimes to the Korean people''
