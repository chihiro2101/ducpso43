The ``greenhouse effect'' may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future storms up to 50 percent stronger than Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert some meteorologists say
Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mph winds this past week killing at least 41 people
That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes this century to hit the United States the National Hurricane Center's Miles Lawrence said today
Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with current ocean temperatures said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Stephen Schneider deputy director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Denver said his research suggests the warming trend is already here
Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when its winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream before hitting the East Coast Schneider said
