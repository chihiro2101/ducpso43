Rescuers searched through debris today for victims of an earthquake that ravaged one-third of this country's territory and parts of India killing at least 650 people and injuring thousands
The death toll was expected to climb from Sunday's pre-dawn quake on the India-Nepal border which triggered landslides and floods and was the mountainous region's deadliest in 38 years
Officials in both countries said they had yet to receive reports from the remote Himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor which knocked out power and communications and was said to injure at least 3000 people
Niranjan Thapa Nepal's minister of state for home affairs told a news conference at least 450 were dead and up to 1000 injured
He said officials expected the numbers to climb
Indian officials reported at least 200 people dead and more than 2000 injured most by debris from collapsing buildings
The quake centered almost on the India-Nepal border registered 65 on the Richter scale
Medical teams in India carried medicine and other supplies to overcrowded hospitals and the army was deployed to help search for victims
But the monsoons which hit the subcontinent in late June and usually last through September hampered relief operations
Bir Bahadur Shahi secretary of the home affairs ministry flew to eastern Nepal on Sunday
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi flew to Bihar to tour some of the hardest hit areas
Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha of Nepal visited some of the victims at Bir Hospital in his capital Katmandu
