The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks now routinely done at many large hospitals is unnecessary and should be abandoned according to a major study released Tuesday
The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs they usually don't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure known as angioplasty
Some experts said the results are good news because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals where angioplasty is not available
The study also has an important financial message
Its authors estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart attacks it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $704 million
``This trial has settled one of the most important questions in modern-day cardiology'' commented Dr J Ward Kennedy of the University of Washington Seattle
The latest study presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association was intended to see whether people did better still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after giving TPA
Dr Thomas J Ryan of Boston University Medical Center commented ``We have the answer in this trial to a very important question of health care delivery''
