Marilyn Quayle wife of Vice President Dan Quayle praised the heroism of this tornado-ravaged northern Alabama city's residents during a visit Saturday
Mrs Quayle personally thanked workers cleaning up the debris left by Wednesday's twister and visited some of the injured at Crestwood Hospital during her 2{-hour tour
The tornado left 18 people dead hundreds injured and up to 1000 homeless
The youngest victim a 2{-year-old girl died Friday after being taken off life-support systems
``The community is filled with heroes _ people who without  regard to their own personal danger helped other citizens so that they could survive'' said Mrs Quayle who was accompanied by Gov Guy Hunt and US Sens
Mrs Quayle who made similar visits to San Francisco after the Oct 17 earthquake and Charleston SC after Hurricane Hugo also praised corporations that have made donations to help Huntsville recover
Federal and state officials have promised to do whatever is necessary to help Huntsville even if disaster relief funds are squeezed by Hurricane Hugo and the quake
``We're here to get the job done'' Grant Peterson associate director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday
President Bush declared Huntsville a disaster area but FEMA may have to do some financial juggling to deal with this year's rash of natural disasters
``Any one disaster like Hugo or the earthquake in California exceeds  what we have in a normal year alone'' Peterson said
Congress provided $11 billion in supplemental funds to FEMA after Hugo devastated the Caribbean and the East Coast in September and $12 billion following the earthquake that ravaged parts of northern California on Oct 17
He requested donations to agencies such as the American Red Cross which set up a shelter for the homeless as rescue workers dug through the rubble in those desperate hours after the tornado struck
Huntsville is home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center the Army's Redstone Arsenal and a number of high-tech industries
