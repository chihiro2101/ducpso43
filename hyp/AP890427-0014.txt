Bob Thomas has covered Hollywood for The Associated Press for 45 years
She never knew how great she was
Amid the blimp-size egos of the entertainment world Lucille Ball stood out like an orange beacon
She never exercised her considerable power
She always seemed astonished even embarrassed when honors inevitably came her way
Whenever she was praised for ``I Love Lucy'' she invariably replied ``Well all of the credit should go to (writers)
Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll Jr''
Or she cited co-stars Desi Vivian Vance and Bill Frawley
Unlike many stars Lucille Ball rarely indulged in self-analysis
