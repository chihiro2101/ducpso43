The international community is starting to look beyond the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude and seriousness of ethnic and political conflicts in the former Soviet Union
The problem is indeed a pressing one
The disputes in the Transcaucasus central Asia and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union are causing great suffering for those involved
They are a source of legitimate concern to the Russians who are worried by clashes close to their borders
They are concerned too about the safety of ethnic Russians living in those countries where there are conflicts and about the economic and social consequences of refugees fleeing to Russia (whose potential number is estimated at more than 2m)
Equally these disputes are of legitimate concern to Britain its western partners and the whole international community both for humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoking regional instability
Crises in Russia's newly independent neighbours may also complicate Russia's relations with the west unless they are carefully handled they risk prejudicing the emerging relationship between us
Nor are countries that secured their independence when the Soviet Union was dissolved keen that the west should concede to Moscow the same role it played in the Soviet empire
If we are to fashion a joint approach by Russia and its western partners to the problem of peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union we must address all these concerns
Although the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the UN lack the resources to put large numbers of peacekeepers on the ground themselves they may be able to suggest measures to enhance transparency and to monitor the peace process
Extending co-operation within the North Atlantic Co-operation Council and also co-operation between Russia and Nato might help improve training for Russian peacekeepers
We discussed ways of strengthening the CSCE's role including the role of the High Commissioner for National Minorities at the recent Rome ministerial meeting
