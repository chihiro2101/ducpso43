Debi Thomas' dream of Olympic gold turned into disappointment Saturday as East Germany's Katarina Witt won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian Elizabeth Manley took home the silver before a crowd of cheering countrymen
Back to school'' said Thomas who won the bronze medal despite three faulty landings
While the top two skaters in the world staged a shootout to music from Bizet's ``Carmen'' Manley was so sensational in the freestyle that she finished first with seven judges
Combined with a fourth in the compulsory figures and a third-place finish in the short program earlier in the week the performance put Manley in second place
Witt a three-time world champion from East Germany became the first repeat singles champion since Dick Button took Olympic gold in 1948 and '52
Thomas of San Jose Calif the first black to win a US figure skating crown and the 1986 world champion skated poorly Saturday after doing well earlier in the Games
