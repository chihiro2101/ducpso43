The Chinese government says that 300 soldiers ``thugs'' bystanders and students have been killed during the martial law occupation of Beijing
State Council spokesman Yuan Mu said on Tuesday that 7000 people including 5000 soldiers have been injured and 400 other soldiers are missing and may be dead or wounded
In Washington US intelligence reports indicate 3000 people probably were killed according to a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity
Nearly all of the deaths and injuries occurred Saturday night and early Sunday when troops firing randomly into large crowds smashed through barricades to reach Tiananmen square and attack demonstrators demanding democratic reforms
Some officials of China's Red Cross said 2600 people were killed but Beijing's Red Cross office has refused to provide any figures
An Eastern European diplomat whose country has good relations with China insisted that 12000 people were slain by soldiers as they attacked protesters in Tiananmen Square
But students who had joined the Tiananmen occupation said hundreds of colleagues from the Academy of Fine Arts who were huddled around their ``Goddess of Democracy'' statue in the square were shot or crushed by tanks
