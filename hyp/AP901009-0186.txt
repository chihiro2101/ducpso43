The world is better today for sharing a time with you''

None of the other Beatles were at the United Nations but a tribute came from Lennon's old songwriting partner Paul McCartney who released a live version of the Beatles' tune ``Birthday''
The song originally on the ``White Album'' was the first Lennon-McCartney single released since the Beatles broke up in 1969
In Lennon's hometown in England fans gathered at the former site of the Cavern Club where the Beatles were discovered
During her brief remarks Ono also quoted a line from another of Lennon's songs ``Happy Xmas (War is Over)'' ``Remember war is over if you want it''
