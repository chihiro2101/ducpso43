Children whose families escaped the horrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard turned into a killing field the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and a pistol bearing the word ``victory''
After the massacre at recess the bodies of three Southeast Asian children were outlined in blue on the playground of Cleveland Elementary School where they died
Two others had been dragged by teachers inside to a classroom but also died
I was scared'' said sixth-grader Binh Hoang who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in the final days of war and had never before heard gunfire
Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy 26 armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle entered the school grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 rounds before he shot himself to death
Afterward a large handgun and the assault rifle lay on the ground near a pool of blood and the gunman's body
Binh said she was sitting in math class when the shooting began outside the wood-and-stucco school building
The gunfire startled Michael Cuevas whose first thought was that the University of the Pacific fraternities near his house were firing their miniature cannon again
``I never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen in Stockton'' said Cuevas a 29-year-old marine clerk at the Port of Stockton who lives down the street from the elementary school
About 60 percent of Cleveland Elementary's students are of Southeast Asian descent said John Klose spokesman for the Stockton School District
