A Soviet newspaper has painted a highly sympathetic portrait of Andrei D Sakharov and Yelena Bonner countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as traitors by the state-run media
But the account in Moscow News only indirectly mentioned the nearly seven years Sakharov spent in forced internal exile for criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan indicating that topic is still too sensitive
In its latest issue the weekly devoted its entire back page to describing the home life of Sakharov 66 the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner and said the words most often heard in his seventh-floor Moscow apartment are ``help me''
Since then Sakharov who was one of the creators of his nation's hydrogen bomb has vocally supported Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev's reform campaign but has called for the liberation of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of human rights
