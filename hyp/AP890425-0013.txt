Thousands of grieving friends and relatives of the fallen 47 crewmen from the battleship USS Iowa gathered quietly Monday and heard President Bush praise their loved ones as ``brothers in eternity''
``We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished and in fact for the 11 who survived'' the president told a packed memorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station
``They all were in the words of a poet `the men behind the guns'
``They came from Hidalgo Texas Cleveland Ohio Tampa Florida Costa Mesa California
They came to the Navy as strangers served the Navy as shipmates and friends and left the Navy as brothers in eternity
In the finest Navy tradition they served proudly on a great battleship the USS Iowa''
The president a World War II Navy pilot said he was proud to recommission the Iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11 battle stars in two wars
But with the still-unexplained fire and explosion last Wednesday in the battleship's No 2 gun turret he said ``Fate has written a sorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship''
Fred P Moosally said the turret's crew was the best gun crew on the ship and called its chief _ Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald Owen Ziegler of Port Gibson NY
Victims' relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dress blues were among the 6000 people crowded into a hangar for the service
As many as 500 Iowa crewmen were unable to attend the service because they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted to enter the hangar because of security measures to protect Bush
At the end of the service while the Navy Hymn was played President and Mrs Bush greeted and consoled the families of the lost men
Moosally said the blast occurred just as he was turning to Vice Adm Jerome Johnson commander of the 2nd Fleet to tell him to watch the No 2 turret because it contained his best crew
John P Morse the Iowa's weapons officer said the guns were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident and Moosally said he had no hesitation about the guns' safety
One of the survivors Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L Truitt 21 of Tampa Fla said that at first the men down in the powder magazine in the lowest level of the turret didn't know anything was wrong
