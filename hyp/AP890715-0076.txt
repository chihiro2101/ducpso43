Joseph B Gildenhorn the lawyer and real estate developer named by President Bush as US ambassador to Switzerland and his immediate family gave nearly $230000 to Republican campaigns since 1984 disclosure statements show
Gildenhorn according to Senate sources is one of several Bush ambassadorial nominees who have been rated ``unqualified'' by the American Academy of Diplomacy an organization composed of former high ranking diplomats including all living former secretaries of state
One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporters and contributors named to diplomatic posts Gildenhorn gave $100000 during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National State Elections Committee
The gift was not subject to the disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act
The 84 contributions made between 1984 and early this year by Gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by Senate Democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many GOP contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved for Foreign Service professionals
A report prepared by the State Department for the Foreign Relations Committee said Gildenhorn would make an ``excellent'' candidate for an ambassadorship because of his ``solid background in law and management''
``Mr Gildenhorn has been a strong Republican supporter being a member of the Eagles and Team 100'' the State Department said
The Republican Eagles are contributors of $10000 or more in a single year to the Republican National Committee while Team 100 designates people who have donated $100000 or more
Gildenhorn's political contributions are listed on a disclosure form submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee which has set a hearing on the nomination for this week
Additionally his wife Alma Lee gave $20125 over the six years including $13000 in 1988 his daughter Carolyn gave $2000 his son Michael gave $4050 and his father Oscar Gildenhorn gave $5750
