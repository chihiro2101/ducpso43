The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this community on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives an insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing phenomenon
Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary telephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc's corporate headquarters in Bentonville Ark Chairman Sam Walton was about to land at a nearby airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring him to the De Soto store
Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on
His example is followed by other Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of time in the field
Says Ed Nagy district manager for 9 stores in the Dallas metropolitan area ``It's not like `Uh-oh someone's coming' because they're always out''
Everyone from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer David Glass down to an hourly store worker can readily quote the gospel according to Sam as he is called
A close associate says Sam would ``probably give anything'' not to be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiest people
He graduated from the University of Missouri with an economics degree in 1940 and joined JC Penney Co as a management trainee in Des Moines Iowa
After serving three years in the Army he went to Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store eventually becoming the company's biggest franchisee
The seeds of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and his brother James L or Bud opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962
