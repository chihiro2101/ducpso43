A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a celebrated battle underwater explorer Robert D Ballard said Thursday
During a 90-minute news conference Ballard described how he his ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck ``sitting upright and proud'' two weeks ago
Then the American oceanographer whose father was of British background and whose mother was of German heritage addressed himself to the German people in German
``I am an underwater explorer not a treasure hunter'' he said translating himself back into English
He said he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship which sank after a battle May 27 1941
Ballard a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts said structural evidence satisfied him that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire
It is known that two years earlier Hitler ordered the German pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled after it was cornered in the neutral port of Montevideo Uruguay and attacked by British ships
Before the battle British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit with a ringing three-word command ``Sink the Bismarck''
The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within five days of going to sea the Bismarck had sunk the Hood in a three-minute engagement with the loss of all but three of the vessel's crew of 1419
