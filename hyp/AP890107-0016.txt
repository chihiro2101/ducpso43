TOKYO (AP _ Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for one overwhelming decision during his 62-year reign Japan must bow to defeat for the first time in its history and end the Pacific conflict in World War II
Shortly after that decision and for most of his reign Hirohito became a figurehead isolated from his subjects by tradition and steeped in his great love the study of marine biology
He was the last survivor among the national leaders of the World War II era
But in his first 20 years the ``Son of Heaven'' was worshiped as a divinity descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu
The solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so intrigued Hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man who became the 124th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne at the age of 25 on Christmas Day 1926 designating his reign ``Showa'' _ ``enlightened peace''
The emperor was generally portrayed as having played no significant role in planning or carrying out Japan's military adventures in the 1930s and 1940s
But it was his first effective decision as emperor and his most courageous that ended the Pacific conflict
Should Japan agree to the Allies' surrender demand or fight on until annihilation
Speaking in what some of those present described as a slow and obviously nervous monotone Hirohito the spiritual and titular leader offered his opinion for the first time
He spoke of his sorrow over the soldiers and sailors killed in the long war and of families who lost everything in air raids
Then evoking a memory of his grandfather the Emperor Meiji whose reign (1867-1912) saw the end of 250 years of feudal Japanese isolation from the outside world Hirohito told the officers
In a national radio broadcast Aug 15 _ the first time ordinary Japanese ever actually heard his voice _ he personally announced the decision to surrender
Three weeks later Hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat striped trousers and a top hat to meet the Allied commander Gen Douglas A MacArthur at the US Embassy in Tokyo
