THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid blunt and salty language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalists has surprised some people
It has even been suggested that the recording of the prime minister's conversation with Michael Brunson ITN's political editor in which Major used a variety of four- six- and eight-letter words to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues may do him good
With luck it is reckoned Major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction
Major is a gonner especially after this week's revolt of the wooden-tops in the Christchurch by-election where a Conservative majority of 23015 at last year's general election was converted into a 16427 majority for the Liberal Democrats
Fifteen months too late the voters of Christchurch rounded on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury
In reality all politicians not just Major are far more candid and salty when chatting in private than when speaking in public
In public they have to be careful of what they say so their utterances achieve a horrible mattness
To show you what I mean I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith
Smith a Scot is leader of the Labour Party though not many people know that
In the aftermath of Christchurch where Labour lost its deposit I wanted to provoke the two Johns into a spot of real soul-searching
But I have left out the swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide states that 'the gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities is discouraged
I said 'Did you read John what Olivier Blanchard Rudiger Dornbusch Stanley Fischer Franco Modigliani Paul A Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote in just one article in the FT this week
Likewise with political and constitutional reform Michael for by the L - - d tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow I'll laugh
After that I thought of telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown leader of the Liberal Democrats to solicit his views on Christchurch
