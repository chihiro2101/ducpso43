Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs the US-based investment bank assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid
The writs were filed late last week in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan by trustees for Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme and Maxwell Communication Corpora-tion Works Pension Scheme
The writs centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m of MCC shares from the pension schemes by two Swiss trusts Servex and Yakosa which were transacted through Goldman and for which the schemes were never paid
The writs also allege that on May 28 1991 - the same date Mr Kevin Maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for - Goldman was due to receive Dollars 582m for an unrelated transaction selling MCC stock to an unnamed American lawyer 'with close connections to Robert Maxwell'
