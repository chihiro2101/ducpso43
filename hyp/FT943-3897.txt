It is a sensational shortlist a bestseller about love and hypnotism a blockbuster about battles and brides in Ruritania and a pornographic shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure Newcastle publisher would risk printing it
Out are the eminences gris of Victorian letters - novels by Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward who advised Gladstone and Roosevelt didn't make the grade
This week the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announced by six judges including biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg
They have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today
George du Maurier's Trilby Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda George Moore's Esther Waters Kipling's Jungle Book
George Gissing's In the Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide
The winner will be revealed on October 15 (four days after the 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature
Like today's Booker Prize it is a publishing gimmick Everyman which is backing the spoof award is a significant publisher of classic Victorian novels
But the retrospective Booker is also a fascinating exercise in historical reconstruction
It raises questions about how the relationship between literature and society has changed in the past 100 years
Of the 1894 books Trilby is the tale of a tone-deaf model who sings like an angel when mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist Svengali then croaks like a crow when he dies during one of her concerts
The Prisoner of Zenda tells of an Englishman impersonating the King of Ruritania and rescuing him from demons
On the 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is about a Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels re-enacts the wolf-child legend
Both for instance have books about colonial exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise which is set in the First World War in German East Africa
Last week a Times critic complained about the inclusion of Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love The Folding Star on the Booker list because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethics
But even if Hollinghurst wins the Booker his novel will not become the succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby which became the bestselling novel of the 19th century
The trick works - last year's winner Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360000 hardback copies
