TONIGHT in the big stadium in Barcelona the athletics is dominated by the four relay finals
What the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event is that at the Olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries - or to those rather that choose to lavish resources on athletes
The US has comfortably won the most relay medals followed by Britain the former Soviet Union the former West Germany (not even counting the six won before 1939) the former East Germany France and Canada
Britain alone have won more relay medals (23) than all the Caribbean islands (nine) and Africa (four including one for South Africa)
The Dutch with one have more relay medals than all the nations of Asia (nil) and South America (nil) combined
In the 4x100m heats James Jett replaced Carl Lewis but Lewis ran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue his eighth Olympic gold
Even here there is a US connection Morcelli attended Riverside Community College in California to hone his running on good tracks
