Oscar selection has come under scrutiny as film studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
And with the flood of Oscar vote enticements _ from free coffee mugs to complimentary buffet dinners _
Academy members are acknowledging that some Oscar voting is done by committee in violation of the rules
Secretaries spouses and friends several Academy members say are marking ballots in what is supposed to be the entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition
``It's like a local election of judges'' said Academy member Harry Clein who said he's witnessed team voting
Dan Lyle who oversees the Oscar balloting for the accounting firm Price Waterhouse Inc said that there is no guarantee that Academy members have actually filled out their own ballots
More than 4600 members were given ballots this year for the 61st Annual Academy Awards which will be telecast on March 29 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles
Since the voting is done secretly _ members do not sign their ballots _ the ballot's authenticity is ensured solely by a numeric control number Lyle said
Meanwhile other Oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken speculates veteran Academy member Millard Kaufman
This year all best picture nominees and the large majority of top acting nominees came from movies released in December ``The Accidental Tourist'' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' ``Rain Man'' and ``Working Girl'' were all released after Dec 16
``I think the Academy Awards are crap'' said Terry Gilliam director of ``Brazil'' and the current ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen''
And at least one prominent Academy member director Carl Reiner says that the manipulation of Oscar voters has reached new depths
Reiner said that Universal Studios' all-out effort to bag votes for Sigourney Weaver a best actress nominee for ``Gorillas in the Mist'' could lead him to vote against the film
