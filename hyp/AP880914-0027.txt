Mark Zimmer a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center reported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at Gilbert's center at 2613 inches at 552 pm EDT on Tuesday
``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere'' Zimmer said
The damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic _ shrubs and trees blown down all street signs gone roofs and windows blown away and shattered and mobile homes destroyed
If the atmospheric conditions in general allow this warm chimney to build to very high levels 10-12 miles high then you can have a severe hurricane''
