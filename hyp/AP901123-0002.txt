For almost a decade Margaret Thatcher was regarded at the White House as America's best friend the trusted ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of administration policies
Among Western allies she was alone at Ronald Reagan's side in 1986 in supporting the US bombing of Libya
In the Persian Gulf crisis she boldly joined with George Bush in sending troops to the Middle East
``You always know where she was and what she believed'' Bush said upon hearing of her decision to resign
``She has always been an outstanding ally of the United States'' he said
There were many doubters around the world when Reagan arrived in Washington with an economic program of free-market capitalism that seemed out of step with the times
Mrs Thatcher wasn't one of the skeptics she was advocating a similar program at home
Reagan successfully fired the nation's air traffic controllers dealing a devastating blow to labor
On foreign policy she frequently was more right wing than Reagan - certainly more so than Bush
Mrs Thatcher encouraged the huge Pentagon buildup that Reagan nurtured under the theme of peace through strength
When Argentina and Britain clashed militarily over the Falkland Islands the United States was forced to make a painful choice between two allies
The Berlin Wall was collapsing and it appeared as if Bush found German Chancellor Helmut Kohl more interesting than Mrs Thatcher
