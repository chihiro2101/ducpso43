A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug-addled anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is ``totally fiction''
Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast
``It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license
It's a very dramatically described something but it's not about John'' Ono said Wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman
The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon'' which presents the ex-Beatle as a violent drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife
Goldman also charges she was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as Lennon
