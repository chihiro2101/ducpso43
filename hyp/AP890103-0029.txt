Authorities charged a 22-year-old ferry captain with negligent homicide after the boat overcrowded with New Year's travelers sank off the Caribbean coast
Officials said 46 people survived the sinking of the ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II in Amatique Bay on Guatemala's east coast Sunday
Juan Pablo Ezquibel was arrested after authorities determined that about 120 people were aboard the 30-ton ferry which was authorized to carry 90 said Capt Anibal Giron Arreola second-in-command at the Puerto Barrios naval base
He said by telephone that the ferry ran out of fuel midway on a 16-mile run across the bay from Livingston to Puerto Barrios and sank after a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port
Officials had yet to determine the exact cause of the sinking but Giron Arreola said the ferry captain was slow to respond to requests by the skipper of the naval patrol boat to take control of the ferry's wheel once it was under tow
