Public interest in the Earth's troubled climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to end the current US drought weather experts warned during a drought symposium here
``Society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria'' said Pat Michaels Virginia's state climatologist and moderator of the symposium
He said the 1988 drought although not as dry as a 1986 drought in many places has drawn much attention because some of the affected areas include large media centers
Many of the 13 climatologists and meterologists at the symposium agreed that the Earth's temperature is warming but they debated whether it is a short- or long-term phenomenon and its impact on Earth
However Alan Hecht director of the National Climate Program in Washington DC said the uncertainty means policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effects especially undertaking policies that ``make sense in their own right''
