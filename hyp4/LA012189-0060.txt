In a major rebuff to the Soviet Union's scientific establishment Soviet physicists Friday nominated Nobel laureate Andrei D Sakharov to run as a candidate in nationwide parliamentary elections scheduled for March
The overwhelming vote in favor of the 67-year-old human-rights advocate by his colleagues at Moscow's leading physics institute came only two days after his candidacy was rejected by the governing board of the Academy of Sciences
The attempt to prevent Sakharov from running for a revamped Soviet Parliament has outraged Soviet intellectuals
During a marathon session that ended late Wednesday the governing board of the Academy of Sciences selected 23 scientists as candidates to fill 25 specially reserved seats in the new Congress of People's Deputies
Although Sakharov has publicly expressed his support for President Mikhail S Gorbachev in recent months he seems to have become increasingly concerned about the slow and uneven pace of reform
