Ray Buckey and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey were found not guilty Thursday of molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal trial in history
An eight-man four-woman jury -- 10 of the members parents themselves -- acquitted the Buckeys of 52 counts of molestation after deliberating for nine weeks over evidence that had been presented over the course of more than two years
The jury reported it was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts and a mistrial was declared on those allegations
Ray Buckey 31 left the courtroom without comment -- free on his own recognizance until a decision is reached on whether the district attorney will retry him on the 13 undecided counts
But his 63-year-old mother and co-defendant reacted with anger
"My concern was for my son and what they've done to him    because my son would never harm a child"
Most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been molested but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Buckeys were culpable
"I am not convinced that he (Ray Buckey) is innocent" said juror Sally Cordova 27 a supermarket checker
Whether I believe he did it and whether it was proven are very different"
The end of the case came in a tense and crowded courtroom
The Buckeys who spent years in jail as the case progressed through the judicial system had sat silently staring straight ahead as the jury filed into the room shortly before 1030 am and the gallery of reporters and spectators grew quiet in anticipation
"All the verdicts are the same" said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders handing them to his court clerk
Clerk Stan Ferrell listed the counts numerically and then reading from the verdict form delivered in a single almost anti-climactic sentence the historic trial's close
At first the defendants remained stoic then their eyes began to rim with tears
"I knew God would set my son and me free because we have done nothing" she said as she was driven away
Her optimism was not matched by her son however who she said had "had fear definitely" about what the jury would decide
"I held his hand" Buckey's mother said after the verdicts were announced "and I told him 'I told you Ray' and he felt like he wanted to cry
The acquittals concluded the longest criminal trial in history a case that stemmed from a 2 1/2-year-old's report to his mother six years ago that he had been sodomized at his school by a "Mr Ray"
The case ultimately cost taxpayers more than $15 million altered scores of lives and careers and provided a national focal point for the issue of child abuse
Judge Pounders said he was not surprised by the verdicts "I found it difficult to determine how they would view the evidence in the first place
I thought that based on the evidence that was presented the jury could do almost anything and still find rational support for it
"It is very difficult to test the credibility of children and when you go beyond that the natural tendency for adults is to look for corroboration
Asked if the case was worth its cost in money lives and stress Pounders said he thinks society benefited from the case
"The system doesn't allow us to protect kids" said the father of two alleged victims
Said a tearful mother "I guess maybe it's OK to (molest) kids
"No matter what the jury says whatever anybody says this is the truth
They also criticized the Manhattan Beach Police Department's decision early in the investigation to send out form letters to parents announcing an investigation had begun and soliciting information
"The children" said juror John Breese 51 a biomedical technician "were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them
"I went into the jury room as confused and uncertain as I was the day I first sat in the jury box the first day of this trial" said Brenda Williams 38 a Pacific Bell service representative
"I felt I had missed out on something maybe I had dozed off during some important testimony and I was hoping some of my fellow jurors had something in their notes that I didn't have in mine that would make it all come together"
Said juror Mark Bassett 33 a computer specialist "We just didn't really know what happened"
Atty Lael Rubin who prosecuted the case said a decision has not been made about whether to pursue the 13 counts involved in a mistrial
The conspiracy count against Peggy McMartin Buckey was dismissed outright Thursday
I just hope to God that years from now we don't hear about Ray Buckey molesting children"
Ira Reiner blamed the criminal justice system for the length of the trial and said he backs two state court-reform initiatives
Buckey's mother had been free on a smaller bail amount earlier after spending nearly two years in jail
The mother of a 2 1/2-year-old complained to Manhattan Beach police that her son had been sodomized by "Mr Ray" and subsequent physical examinations indicated he had been sexually abused
Many parents took their youngsters to Children's Institute International a Los Angeles child-abuse diagnostic and treatment center for evaluation the majority were told that their children had been victimized
In March 1984 Ray Buckey was rearrested along with his sister Peggy Ann Buckey his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey his grandmother Virginia McMartin and teachers Betty Raidor Babette Spitler and Mary Ann Jackson
Robert Philibosian running for reelection and the media which caught wind of the investigation were pressing for action
Perhaps the most poignant moment came when an 8-year-old girl told in a wispy voice of having been raped photographed tied up and placed in a dark closet by her teachers five years earlier
