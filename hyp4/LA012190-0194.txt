Geraldo Rivera was interviewing Peggy Ann Buckey on TV
Abby Mann watched listened -- and saw the makings of a movie
Prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against Buckey one of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case
In that 1986 interview Peggy Buckey was "quite eloquent" in arguing that charges against her brother Ray and mother Peggy McMartin Buckey should be dropped as well Mann recalled Friday
Mann an Oscar- and Emmy-winning screenwriter and producer recognized a theme he had tapped before the hysteria of a witch hunt
Soon Mann became a controversial figure in the case itself -- but he got the inside track on movie and book deals
And Thursday's not-guilty verdicts in Ray and Peggy McMartin Buckey's trial gave Mann the happy ending he was hoping for -- happy at least from his point of view
But Mann and his wife Myra who have an 800-page manuscript in the works for Random House and say they are close to finishing a screenplay aren't expected to monopolize the telling of the 6-year-old McMartin case -- or the perspective
At least two other books are planned and at least one prominent television movie producer besides Mann says he is developing a McMartin project
That producer who requested anonymity said he is certain other producers are considering projects as well
Unlike the hottest true-life property of the moment -- the Stuart murder case in Boston which has CBS and The Fries Co racing to produce the first docudrama -- McMartin creates some tricky legal and moral problems
"None of the three networks would touch Ray Buckey's story" predicted Steven White an independent producer who used to be a movie executive for both NBC and ABC
"It raises so many legal and ethical questions at this point it would have to be looked at with a microscope" said Larry Strichman a senior executive in movie development at CBS
Ray Buckey's lawyer Danny Davis and writer Gordon Dillow former columnist for the defunct Los Angeles Herald Examiner have a book proposal that is being pitched to a variety of publishers
