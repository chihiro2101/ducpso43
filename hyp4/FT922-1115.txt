Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Stoney refused to provide MGN with information the statement says
Sir Robert Clark chairman of MGN lists a series of transactions - some of which he stresses may have been perfectly legitimate - that took place in the past few months
He says legal action may be taken against a number of organisations including Goldman Sachs the US investment bank over more than Pounds 40m in transfers from MGN if the bank was aware that they were 'effected for improper purposes'
One transfer to Goldman Sachs was countersigned by Mr Ernest Burrington former managing director at the request of Mr Kevin Maxwell on the reported instruction of Robert Maxwell
