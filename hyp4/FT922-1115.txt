MR MICHAEL STONEY a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies is named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than Pounds 180m of 'unusual' payments from Mirror Group Newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year according to the chairman's statement released with MGN accounts yesterday
Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell two sons of the late Robert Maxwell are named as the other two people most involved in these transactions
Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Stoney refused to provide MGN with information the statement says
Sir Robert Clark chairman of MGN lists a series of transactions - some of which he stresses may have been perfectly legitimate - that took place in the past few months
Notes to the accounts show that MGN made extraordinary provisions of Pounds 4215m in the year to December 29 1991 including Pounds 2086m in pension deficiencies and Pounds 1224m in transactions with Maxwell-controlled companies
