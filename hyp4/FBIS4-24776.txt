[Editorial "There Are Signs of Conservative Party Changing Its Leader"]
In local government elections across Britain yesterday the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever losing control of 17 regional councils and 444 seats
As the ruling party the Tories took just 27 percent of the vote two percentage points lower than their rating in the polls
The results of the local elections showed that the Tories were reduced to the third party nationally behind the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party
The Labour Party controls 90 local councils whereas the Conservatives only control 13 with a sharp contrast in strength between the two sides
The Liberal Democrats had a net gain of 378 seats
Even some former Conservative members of parliament announced publicly to reporters that they would vote for the Liberal Democrats
Of course this was a measure taken by Tories under circumstances of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging constituents who resent the Tories to vote for the Liberal Democrats rather than Labour
They resent John Major's leadership and would most willingly link Major's incompetence and lack of vision with the bitter defeat in the local elections
Even before all of the results were known some Tories openly announced their determination to challenge John Major's position and remove him from office as early as possible
Obviously all of these actions were long planned and are aimed at making John Major suffer an even greater defeat in the European Parliament elections scheduled for 9 June
Nevertheless people around John Major seriously pushed him to betray Thatcher's doctrine while pursuing entirely new "leftist" policies and affecting John Major's moves
