A Hermosa Beach minister who for years has tried in vain to quell rumors tying his church to the McMartin Pre-School scandal announced Sunday that the "extreme stress" of fallout from the case has forced him to seek disability retirement
The Rev John D Eales of St Cross Episcopal Church -- where McMartin pupils claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals -- told the congregation during his sermon that "after much prayer and consultation" he realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims
The McMartin case which prompted the longest and most expensive criminal trial in US history ended Thursday with the acquittal of defendants Ray Buckey and Peggy McMartin Buckey on a total of 52 counts of child molestation at the Manhattan Beach school
Nonetheless the case continues to divide and haunt the South Bay communities where it was centered
St Cross was never named as a defendant in the case and neither Eales nor any other official of the venerable seaside church was ever formally charged
"It's kind of like a violin string -- you can only tighten it so far and then it snaps" Eales said Sunday
