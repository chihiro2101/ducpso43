Though the historic McMartin Pre-School criminal trial finally has ended in acquittals a host of civil lawsuits generated by the Manhattan Beach molestation case conceivably could keep the issue alive in the courts for decades legal experts say
A confusing array of civil actions await resolution
These include a federal civil rights suit filed Friday by Peggy McMartin Buckey against her accusers and others a lawsuit filed by former defendants against a television station and reporter and suits the pre-school owners have filed against their liability insurance carriers
Also Ray Buckey might file a federal suit similar to that of his mother said his attorney Scott Bernstein
And an attorney representing several parents of McMartin attendees said they might now refile lawsuits against the pre-school for emotional distress allegedly suffered by the children
"I'm convinced this case will never end" Eli Gauna who represents Babette Spitler a former teacher at the school said wearily
"It will always be there until everyone who was ever involved gets to old age or dies"
In the criminal case -- the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in US history -- Ray Buckey 31 and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey 63 were acquitted Thursday of 52 counts of molestation involving 11 youngsters who attended the family nursery school in Manhattan Beach
A decision is expected next week over whether those charges will be refiled against Ray Buckey
The verdict was a high mark but not the final moment in a lengthy and entangled legal saga
The criminal case began in March 1984 when seven McMartin teachers were indicted by a county grand jury on 115 counts of molestation
Defendants included Buckey his mother his grandmother Virginia McMartin who was the school founder his sister Peggy Ann Buckey and teachers Spitler Betty Raidor and Mary Ann Jackson
Ira Reiner dropped charges against the latter five defendants citing "incredibly weak evidence"
In 1984 a handful of lawsuits were filed by 22 families seeking monetary damages against the school for medical bills cost of psychiatric therapy and emotional distress arising from the alleged molestations
Greg Mooney an attorney who represented some of the plaintiffs explained that during the criminal preliminary hearing defense attorneys had sought psychiatric records of the alleged victims
Defense attorneys argued that they should be entitled to the records because the children had waived their patient-therapist confidentiality by filing civil suits in which their psychiatric histories would be at issue
"It's a possibility that hangs over the former defendants" said attorney Gauna noting a recent landmark California court decision that set aside the statute of limitations for certain victims
Said one McMartin attendee's parent who asked not to be identified "I might be tempted to file a civil suit to provide a trust fund for my child
Peggy Ann Buckey Virginia McMartin Spitler and Raidor are suing the television station the reporter who broke the McMartin story and others
