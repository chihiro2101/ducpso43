John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was delivered Tuesday as his song ``Imagine'' was played simultaneously for 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday
``A dream we dream alone is only a dream but the dream we dream together is reality
The world is better today for sharing a time with you''
Yoko Ono said at a United Nations ceremony before the playing of ``Imagine''
The slain former Beatle himself issued a call for harmony in a taped message that served as an introduction to the music
War or peace'' said Lennon whose son Sean turned 15 Tuesday
None of the other Beatles were at the United Nations but a tribute came from Lennon's old songwriting partner Paul McCartney who released a live version of the Beatles' tune ``Birthday''
The song originally on the ``White Album'' was the first Lennon-McCartney single released since the Beatles broke up in 1969
``The release date and John's birthday is just a happy coincidence but it's also a nod and a wink to my old mate'' said McCartney 47
In Lennon's hometown in England fans gathered at the former site of the Cavern Club where the Beatles were discovered
