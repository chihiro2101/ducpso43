TOMORROW evening just before the Olympic closing ceremony the last and one of the most prestigious events of the Games will be held
It is also without doubt the most gruelling
Run in high heat high humidity high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course the Barcelona Olympic men's marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run
It is estimated that when the race begins in Mataro a seaside town north of Barcelona the temperature will be an already-uncomfortable 25`C Towards the marathon's end however radiant heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a temperature of up to 30`C
More debilitating still relative humidity in Barcelona in August rises as high as 80 per cent
The last 46km which take the runners 60m higher still to the Olympic stadium at the top of the hill of Montjuic has an average gradient of more than 45 per cent and includes some sections of 7 per cent equivalent in skiing terms to a steep 'red' run
Last Saturday in the Olympic stadium I watched the final moments and aftermath of the women's marathon begun at the same time of day and run in similar conditions
Never in any event voluntarily entered into sporting or otherwise have I seen such signs of physical and mental distress
The race was won by the Unified Team's Valentina Yegorova in 2 hours 32 minutes a time considerably slower than that achieved by women on less demanding Olympic marathon courses in Los Angeles and Seoul
After her nearest competitor Japan's Yuko Arimori came in eight seconds later they had the energy - between bouts of grimacing and lowering their heads to their knees - to embrace each other and smile for the cameras
As a photographer calmly shot off a roll of film a foot from her face Manuela Machado of Mexico and another runner stood vomiting violently into a potted palm
I spoke to Britain's Steve Brace winner of the Paris marathon in 1989 and 1990 the Berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the Barcelona event
The winner of the London marathon earns a tidy Dollars 50000 and the New York Boston and Japanese runs are all in the same prize-winning category
