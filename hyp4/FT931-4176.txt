A ROW has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange India's largest stock market and the Securities and Exchange Board of India the securities watchdog over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers' books
The Sebi has accused stockbrokers of flouting the exchange's rules including regulations on margin trading designed to limit the risk of members defaulting through excessive speculative investments
It has also accused the exchange authorities of failing to enforce rules and of poor administration
This week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which began almost as soon as Sebi started operations a year ago
It was established by Mr Manmohan Singh the finance minister as a crucial element in financial reform
