Super Bowl XXIV was the most watched television event of the week viewed by a whopping 63% of TV viewers but not even Joe Montana could lift CBS out of the cellar in the ratings race it was reported today
It was CBS' bad luck that the game was so predictably lopsided which resulted in the lowest rating since Super Bowl III in 1969
But last Sunday's game had almost twice as many viewers as the estimated 5919 million who watched Kansas City beat Minnesota 20 years ago
