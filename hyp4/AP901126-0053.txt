Margaret Thatcher set the example of what a woman could achieve in British society but her critics say she did little else to help women along
For some it was enough that her political career reached the heights
One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her 7-year-old daughter wondered what title Mrs Thatcher's successor would hold since ``he couldn't be called prime minister that's a girl's name''
Emma Nicholson a Conservative Party lawmaker said it was once unthinkable that a woman would ever be a British prime minister
``She has broken the mold once and forever'' Ms Nicholson said in an interview
Mrs Thatcher who trained as a chemist before studying law said she viewed herself as prime minister not as a woman
Mrs Thatcher who stepped down on Thursday urged women to get involved in politics but did little to pull them up the ladder
Several female lawmakers were appointed to junior executive posts in various ministries but the only woman to serve in a Thatcher Cabinet was Baroness Young leader of the House of Lords from 1981 to 1983
Trree men are vying to succeed her as Conservative Party leader and thus prime minister in a vote by party lawmakers set for Tuesday
