An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease researchers said today
The surgery called a partial ileal bypass has one significant drawback
In the operation doctors change the route of the small intestine so about one-third of it is bypassed
Dr Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota who directed the study said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment
The study was conducted in Minneapolis Los Angeles Philadelphia and Little Rock Ark and published in today's New England Journal of Medicine
