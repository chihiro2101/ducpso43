On the spot where Lenin once spoke the focus Tuesday was on Lennon
Official newspapers which once denounced the Beatles as harmful pests from the decadent West joined a worldwide celebration and ran stories of tribute about the late John Lennon who would have turned 50 on Tuesday
An anchorman more accustomed to reading official government news reported on the worldwide Lennon birthday bash and called his song ``Imagine'' an ``anthem of peace''
About 1000 Soviets mostly second generation Beatles fans flocked to the Moscow Electrical Lamp Factory's cultural hall in northeastern part of the city to rejoice in Lennon's music
A plaque outside the hall reminded Beatles fans that Lennon's near namesake Vladimir Lenin the founder of the Soviet state had spoken at the spot in 1917 and 1919
Andrei Trushkin a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda - the Communist Party youth newspaper that devoted a full page Tuesday to Lennon - said he appeals to Soviet youth in part because he was a rebel like many of them and was a ``difficult teen-ager''
