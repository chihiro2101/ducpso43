TROOPS OF the former Soviet Union were ordered to pull out from the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday after they were fired on during clashes between Azeri and Armenian militants
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov the Commonwealth of Independent States' defence minister announced the decision as fighting worsened in the disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce
The enclave is administered by Azerbaijan but largely populated by Armenians
The order for the pull-out of the 366th motorised regiment follows the deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting between Armenian guerrillas and Azerbaijani forces
