Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or if we are being old-fashioned Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There
I entirely concur with their choice
In case you did not see that marvellous film this in essence was the plot
a man no one knows anything about a gardener called Chauncey rises without trace to become by the end of the film a serious candidate for the US presidency
Chauncey played by Peter Sellers utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner
In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe
John Major must at some level have appreciated the similarity between his own strangely intangible rise and that of Chauncey's
In an interview with Farmers Weekly a few days ago Major disclosed an unknown fact his father was once a farmer
Francis Wheen of The Guardian a keen student of Major's mysterious past immediately rang 10 Downing Street which claimed that Major's father farmed near Bromsgrove in 1910
As Wheen pointed out Major was an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that time and - a minor point this - Bromsgrove is not in Shropshire
Margaret Thatcher was notoriously dogmatic even in public and so too was Edward Heath even though he always pretended to be a 'consensus politician'
