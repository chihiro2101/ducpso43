WHILE Hurricane Andrew was wreaking havoc across large parts of southern Florida and Louisiana this week a grade two dollar crisis (on a one-to-four scale four being most severe) was blowing itself out at the end of a tumultuous few days for US and world financial markets
On Wall Street most of the damage from the currency storm was inflicted a week ago Friday and on the following Monday when bond yields jumped sharply and the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by more than 75 points
The flimsy walls erected hastily by the Federal Reserve and other big central banks to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of selling on foreign exchange markets failed to hold and as the sellers poured through the breached barricades the currency dropped to DM140
The conditions necessary for a dollar crisis had been building up in currency markets for some time
Interest rate differentials between US and Germany widened over the summer as the Fed eased and the Bundesbank tightened their respective monetary policies
The failure of the US economy to climb out of recession with any vigour was also making overseas investors increasingly unhappy about holding the dollar
Since there are an estimated 250000 people left homeless by the storm there is a lot of work to be done
