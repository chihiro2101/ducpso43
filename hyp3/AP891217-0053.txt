Mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief Sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flower-draped body of Andrei D Sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described as his country's conscience
Crimean Tatars and Jewish refuseniks _ two of the groups Sakharov helped _ joined rank-and-file Communists teachers and engineers in filing past the body of the physicist Nobel Peace Prize winner human rights advocate and legislator
Based on official sources an estimated 45000 people filed through and the flow of mourners continued into the night
A friend of the family speaking on condition of anonymity said he heard estimates that 70000 mourners viewed the body before it was returned to Sakharov's apartment at midnight
one elderly woman cried out as she saw Sakharov's body in an open coffin sloping to the floor of the beige marble Youth Palace in central Moscow
She apparently meant to apologize for not recognizing his contributions earlier
A mound of red and white carnations grew steadily at Sakharov's feet and a spotlight was focused on a portrait showing Sakharov with his hands over his mouth deep in thought
Sakharov died Thursday alone in his study at the age of 68 apparently of a heart attack ending a three-decade fight against the jailing of innocent people for free emigration for disarmament and other causes
Sunday was the first of two days of memorial ceremonies and the outpouring was remarkable for a man who was once ostracized and committed to nearly seven years in internal exile in the remote city of Gorky
There were signs of grief throughout this snowy capital of 9 million people as though a government leader had died
