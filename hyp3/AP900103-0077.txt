Former East German leader Erich Honecker may be moved to a monastery to protect him from a possible lynching by enraged citizens a newspaper said Wednesday
In a front-page story the mass-circulation Bild newspaper said ``Lynch Danger _ Church Wants to Grant Honecker Asylum''
Since Honecker was ousted Oct 18 the former Communist Party leader and other party officials have come under investigation for charges of corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state
Bild said it had information that ``Lutheran and Catholic church sources have offered Honecker _ who is threated by public rage _ protection and refuge''
