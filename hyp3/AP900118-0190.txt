Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and a police department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case
Seven jurors who spoke with reporters in a joint news conference after acquitting Raymond Buckey and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey on 52 molestation charges Thursday said they felt some children who testified may have been molested _ but not at the family-run McMartin Pre-School
And they said some children may have merely repeated stories told them by their parents and interviewers at Children's Institute International
The private child therapy center which specializes in abused children videotaped interviews with children from the McMartin school after reports of molestations surfaced
Jurors saw the tapes in which interviewers used anatomically explicit puppets and leading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation from children
Asked what led to acquittals juror Brenda Williams focused on the taped interviews from the center jurors call CII
``The CII interviews _ I could not accept them'' Mrs Williams said
``I believe the children believe what they were saying was true
But at CII I could not tell if the children were saying what was told to them (by interviewers) or if they were repeating what their parents had told them
``If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had not seen them I could have believed the children a little more'''
They gave me a lot of reasonable doubt'' agreed juror Julie Peters 47 a supermarket meat wrapper
They never had a chance to tell their stories'' said juror John Breese 51 a medical technician and grandfather of five
Equal criticism was aimed at a letter sent in 1983 by the Manhattan Beach Police Department to parents of McMartin school children
