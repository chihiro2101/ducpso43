Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors botched it while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype
Mother-and-son defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey 63 and Raymond Buckey 31 wept as the verdicts were announced
Jurors found the pair innocent of 52 charges and couldn't reach a verdict on 13 other counts
Prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges in a new trial
``I just said `I told you Ray'''
Asked if her son was surprised she said
Buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with his lawyer
``If it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to you too
If it had not been in my faith in God I wouldn't be here today'' she said
But several parents of former students at the school said the Buckeys won because the system lost
``It was never done properly'' said parent Alan Lagunoff who moved to Central California from suburban Manhattan Beach
I fear that because of this verdict no child will be seen as a credible witness from now on''
His son now 10 attended the school for 1{ years but wasn't a witness at the trial
``I don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into the courts
``My concern primarily was Lael Rubin who is `anything goes' in order to secure a conviction
