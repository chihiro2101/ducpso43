The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port where about 3000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors
Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 at 541 pm just one minute later than Navy officials had estimated
Twenty minutes later families started filing aboard the ship exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors
``They wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to get home'' said Capt Steven Karalekas
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No 2 gun turret which extends six decks down into the ship
There were 11 survivors inside the turret all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines the Navy said
Two of the surviving crewmen of No 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier with full crews on the ship's two other turrets the Navy said
The No 2 turret was in the same position as when the explosion occurred facing right with the left and right guns elevated
When the 887-foot vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers by those on the dock but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier
Adm Powell Carter commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet was on the dock to greet the vessel

The Iowa and its sister ships the battleships Missouri New Jersey and Wisconsin were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War
