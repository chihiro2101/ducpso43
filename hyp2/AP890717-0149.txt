The largest family group to visit black leader Nelson Mandela since he was jailed 27 years ago gathered in Cape Town for a meeting Tuesday with the prisoner on his 71st birthday
His wife Winnie Mandela arrived Monday night and indicated she did not expect Mandela leader of the African National Congress would be freed soon
She said that opinion came from her husband who she visited last week after Mandela's July 5 meeting with President PW Botha
That meeting sparked speculation that Mandela would be freed this year
He is serving a life term after being convicted of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-dominated government
Mrs Mandela referring to her earlier visit with her husband told reporters ``He said from that meeting with PW Botha we musn't construe as indicating his release
Mrs Mandela dressed in black as an expression of mourning spoke with reporters at the DF Malan Airport
The family said 14 relatives including children from both of Mandela's marriages would go to Mandela's house at the Victor Verster prison farm in Paarl north of Cape Town
Evelyn Ntoko Mase the cousin of ANC leader Walter Sisulu who has been imprisoned with Mandela married Nelson Mandela in 1944
