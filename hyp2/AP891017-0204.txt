The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in Northern California
A 1988 report by the US Geological Survey placed the probability of an earthquake of 65 magnitude on the Richter scale at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains
The high probability is based on several factors including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906 said Clarence Allen professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena
He noted that the 1988 report titled ``Probabilities of Large Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault'' presented information that was already widely known among scientists
Frank Baldwin of US Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said the quake's magnitude was 69 on the Richter scale
