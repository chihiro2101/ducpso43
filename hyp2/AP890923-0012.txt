The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and blew apart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school
A huge explosion in a barracks staff room Friday morning leveled the three-story building as bandsmen took a coffee break between practice sessions on the school's parade ground
Twelve of the 22 people injured were hospitalized eight of them in serious condition police said
They said nine of the dead were bandsmen and one other man was not immediately identified
Dozens of neighboring homes in the quiet southeastern English seaside town of Deal were damaged
Although trainees at the school range in age from 16 to 20 Col John Ware principal director of music said the slain bandsmen all were trained adult musicians
The outlawed Irish Republican Army engaged in a 20-year-old campaign to drive the British from the province of Northern Ireland claimed responsibility in a telephone call to Ireland International a Dublin news agency
``Anyone in Deal will tell you how easy it is to get into the base'' said Fred Verge a 70-year-old army veteran
``The big prizes are no longer available to them so they're picking off the ones which they regard  vulnerable''
The mainly Roman Catholic IRA claim gave no details of the operation but said it was a response to a ``message of war'' delivered by Mrs Thatcher when she visited Northern Ireland nine days ago
