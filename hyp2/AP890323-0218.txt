Oscar selection has come under scrutiny as film studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
Academy members are acknowledging that some Oscar voting is done by committee in violation of the rules
Secretaries spouses and friends several Academy members say are marking ballots in what is supposed to be the entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition
``It's like a local election of judges'' said Academy member Harry Clein who said he's witnessed team voting
So they take a look at who's around them and see what the consensus is
``All we know is that a properly numbered ballot has been returned'' he said
``Members are on the honor system to fill out the ballot themselves''
More than 4600 members were given ballots this year for the 61st Annual Academy Awards which will be telecast on March 29 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles
Since the voting is done secretly _ members do not sign their ballots _ the ballot's authenticity is ensured solely by a numeric control number Lyle said
Ballots are invalidated only if there is more than one vote in a given category and only the votes in that specific category are not tallied he said
Nominations for acting directing art direction and all specialized categories are handled by select branches and committees composed of Academy members
Meanwhile other Oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken speculates veteran Academy member Millard Kaufman
I'm getting turned off on the pictures I like''
