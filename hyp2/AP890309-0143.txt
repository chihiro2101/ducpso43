The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected the nomination of former Texas Sen John Tower as defense secretary delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his term
The Senate's 53-47 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate focused on Tower's drinking habits behavior toward women and his business dealings with defense contractors

The Senate galleries were packed and virtually all senators were in their seats as the roll was called
``The nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense is not confirmed'' Quayle intoned after the vote
Kansas GOP Sen Nancy Kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of the final hours of debate when she became the sole Republican to declare her opposition
She said her ``most serious concerns'' were over Tower's activities as a defense consultant after serving as an arms control negotiator
Tower's Republican defenders began to speak of him in the past tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat even before the roll was called
``Just moments ago I took a call from John Tower'' said Sen John Warner of Virginia the senior GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D-Maine moved to repair damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the Senate and President Bush
Sens Charles Robb D-Va Joseph Lieberman D-Conn J Bennett Johnston D-La Dale Bumpers D-Ark and Claiborne Pell D-RI all said they would vote against Tower
