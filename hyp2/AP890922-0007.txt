Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways
``This is a disaster staring us right in the eye'' Mayor Joseph P Riley Jr said from his City Hall command post in Charleston where the hurricane downed power lines snapped trees and caused utility transformers to explode
``All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have taken have been sufficient'' Riley said as Hugo's eye bore in on the city
``I just hope and pray we can get through this without any loss of life''
The roof cracked at City Hall a 188-year-old brick building that has withstood several hurricanes and torrents of water poured into the paneled council chamber
Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 915 pm EDT and about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle of Palms just east of Charleston said Bob Sheets director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables Fla
Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north causing severe flooding as it moved up the East Coast
The storm posed a 19 percent chance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hitting Boston before Sunday night the hurricane center said
As Hugo neared the coast roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach 200 miles north were nearly empty as were the boarded-up resort towns themselves
About 12000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the state as of Thursday evening and more were expected said Bennish Brown a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia 220 miles northwest of here
American Red Cross relief efforts were buckling under the number of evacuees said Brian Ruberry a spokesman in Savannah Ga who appealed for help
