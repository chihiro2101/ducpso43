More than 10000 coal miners in four states were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in Virginia and West Virginia who have waged a bitter strike since April against the Pittston Coal Group
Miners in Pennsylvania and Kentucky today became the third and fourth states to report walkouts at coal companies
The sympathy strikes began Monday in West Virginia and spread to Indiana late Thursday
One United Mine Workers representative said today that the Indiana walkout was prompted by Thursday night's telecast of CBS' ``48 Hours'' which focused on the Pittston strike in which 1600 miners have been off the job since April
Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association to negotiate with the union independently and the two sides have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations
Some said they are asking union members to return to work but Tommy Buchanan international executive board member in UMW District 20 in Birmingham Ala said today the final decision on whether 5000 Alabama miners will join the strike will be with union President Richard Trumka
Most worked for Rochester &amp Pittsburgh Coal Co operations in central Pennsylvania where 1600 miners failed to report for work at midnight Thursday said company spokesman Hank Waneck said
About 290 miners at Peabody's Camp No 1 mine in Morganfield Ky didn't report for work today said company spokesman Tom Clarke
