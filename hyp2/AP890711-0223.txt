Walton who prefers bird-hunting tennis and opening new Wal-Mart stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings is again shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the world's top billionaires
According to Forbes magazine's July 24 edition the Walton family's estimated worth is $87 billion up from its 1988 estimate of $65 billion
``He is unavailable'' said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of the silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain based in Bentonville about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock
Shinkle said he received about 10 calls from reporters Monday morning when the Forbes list appeared in newspapers
