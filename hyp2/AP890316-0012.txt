John G Tower has fallen but the sky has not
For all the forecasts of dire results if the Senate blocked Tower's path to the Pentagon business is proceeding as usual
President Bush said the case was closed and accepted Democratic assurances of future cooperation
That doesn't undo the resentment among some of Tower's more ardent Republican allies in the Senate and in some corners of the White House
Bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded like assurances of support from a dozen Senate Democrats
They ended up with only three Democrats in the close-to-party-line vote against Tower
Nevertheless a week after the former Texas senator was denied confirmation as secretary of defens the waters have closed
``We've established what will be known as the Tower standards'' said Sen John Warner R-Va
That argument will be used by House Republicans challenging the financial conduct of House Speaker Jim Wright
While President Bush was unwavering in his support of Tower he burned no bridges to congressional Democrats
