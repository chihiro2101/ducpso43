Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San Francisco many scientists have believed the next ``big one'' would strike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault
A 1985 paper in the Geophysical Research Letters predicted a 69-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the San Andreas Fault that stretches 50 miles from Palo Alto southward through the Santa Cruz Mountains and on to San Juan Bautista
The epicenter of the quake was about 8 miles northeast of Santa Cruz and 75 miles south of San Francisco
The 1985 study by Columbia University geology professor Christopher Scholz was among several that produced conflicting estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally happened Tuesday
