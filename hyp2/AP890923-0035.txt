The ``greenhouse effect'' may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future storms up to 50 percent stronger than Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert some meteorologists say
Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mph winds this past week killing at least 41 people
Just before Hugo struck the US coast its pressure was measured at 940 millibars
That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes this century to hit the United States the National Hurricane Center's Miles Lawrence said today
Gilbert whose winds reached 180 mph tore up the Caribbean last year killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage
Stephen Schneider deputy director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Denver said his research suggests the warming trend is already here
