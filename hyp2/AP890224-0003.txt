To the rest of the world he was known as Emperor Hirohito but in Japan his given name was seldom used
In Japanese he was simply called Tenno Heika meaning His Majesty The Emperor
The foreign habit of using his name rankled some Japanese who found it impolite and unnecessary since to them there is only one emperor
Some Japanese complained that after his death it even became inaccurate to call him Hirohito because he has been given the posthumous name Showa
The obituary issued in English by the Foreign Press Center which is supported by the Foreign Ministry was headed ``His late Majesty The Emperor Hirohito''
