Lucille Ball the daffy comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy but delighted viewers for four decades died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery
The actress star of the hugely popular ``I Love Lucy'' and related situation comedies seen in more than 80 countries had undergone major heart surgery April 18
She had been recovering steadily getting out of bed and joking with the staff but shortly before dawn Wednesday she went into cardiac arrest due to internal bleeding and could not be revived said Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman Ronald Wise
She suffered a complete heart failure at 5 am and 47 minutes of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless Wise said
``There was nothing to indicate this would happen'' Wise said
``The heart itself apparently was not involved in Miss Ball's sudden death''
In the 6{-hour surgery at Cedars-Sinai doctors replaced her aorta and aortic valve
Although the replaced portion of Miss Ball's aorta did not apparently fail the entire artery was in poor condition when she was operated upon said Dr Robert Kass
Kass who performed the operation said at the time the tearing in Miss Ball's aorta ``progressed all the way down into her abdomen''
Miss Ball with her fire-engine red hair and siren wail was considered the queen of situation comedy and a pioneer of the sitcom format
``I and 100 million others will miss her'' said comedian George Burns
But she also embodied an even greater treasure _ the gift of love'' President Bush said in a statement
``Her red hair her antics on the screen her timing and her zest for life made her an American institution'' former President and Nancy Reagan said in a statement
``It's a shock after working very closely with her and loving her for over 35 years'' said Miss Ball's frequent sidekick Gale Gordon who was in Edmonton Alberta
While in the hospital the comedian was deluged with thousands of cards letters flowers and phone calls from fans as far away as Australia and Europe
Miss Ball and her late former husband Desi Arnaz starred in ``I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957 and have been seen since in widely syndicated reruns
Desilu as their production company was called made some of the top comedy shows of the 1950s and '60s including ``December Bride'' ``Our Miss Brooks'' and ``Make Room for Daddy''
As a blonde she appeared with the Marx Brothers in ``Room Service'' with Fred Astaire in ``Follow the Fleet'' and with Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers in ``Stage Door''
