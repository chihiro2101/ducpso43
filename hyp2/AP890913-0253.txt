Bob Hope keeps voluminous files including the jokes he delivered and people he has performed with and his first entry under Lucille Ball is an appearance with Hope in 1945 on a show called ``GI Journal''
``I really can't remember many details about it'' said Hope who pays tribute to his frequent co-star in an NBC special Saturday night
It's called ``Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucille Ball''
She died in April of this year
That first time together was followed by four movies frequent visits by Hope on ``I Love Lucy'' and regular appearances by Lucy on his television shows
``Lucy was a very funny woman'' Hope said
``Even in private she could get off a great ad lib
A secretary dug the details of that first joint appearance out of one of two vaults where Hope keeps everything pertaining to his long comic career
There are written records of all his shows copies of all the scripts monologues and comic routines audio tapes of his radio shows and thousands of other mementos

``Lucy was in the hospital and I saw her daughter Lucie Arnaz and said `Isn't it wonderful she's doing better'
``Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucy'' will include clips from their movies and TV appearances plus such guest stars as Betty White George Burns and Danny Thomas

Hope recalled his funny co-star in a sunny alcove in the living room of his Los Angeles home

``Someone reminded me the other night of a bus tour we did of movie theaters in New York to promote one our of pictures'' he said
