Defense Secretary-designate John Tower contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the Senate his work for a British firm involved no military matters according to reports published Saturday
One newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents including early-morning car crashes and a hotel fire apparently were overlooked in the probe
The Senate Armed Services Committee has put the nomination of Tower a former Texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee on hold while it takes a second look at Tower's personal habits including his use of alcohol and his links to defense contractors
Tower who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is pending has denied in his Senate testimony any problem with alcohol or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties
A White House spokesman Stephen Hart declined on Saturday to comment on the latest reports saying ``it's (the nomination) before the committee''
In written testimony to the Senate panel on Jan 26 Tower said he could ``recall no actions in connection with any defense activities'' in connection with his work for the US subsidiary of British Aerospace Inc
The Post citing syndicated columnist Cody Shearer said the incidents included an early-morning episode on June 6 1967 when Tower was trapped in his hotel suite in Dallas by a blaze he accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair
