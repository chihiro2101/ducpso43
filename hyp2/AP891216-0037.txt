In what amounted to a public apology Mikhail S Gorbachev and Soviet leaders today eulogized Andrei D Sakharov as a ``man of honesty and sincerity'' who suffered great injustice at the hands of previous rulers
An obituary signed by Gorbachev five other members of the ruling Communist Party Politburo and 50 other leading officials and scholars was printed along with a picture of Sakharov on page 4 of the party daily Pravda
Sakharov 68 died Thursday night in his study just hours after urging fellow members of the Congress of People's Deputies to create a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break its seven-decade strangehold on political power
``A distinguished scientist and public figure a man of honesty and sincerity has passed away'' the obituary said
It was signed by Gorbachev and fellow Politburo members Nikolai I Ryzhkov Vadim A Medvedev Lev N Zaikov Alexander N Yakovlev and Vitaly I Vorotnikov
However the signatures of several other Politburo members including KGB chief Vladimir A Kryuchkov and leading conservative Yegor K Ligachev were missing
