What do Charlie Chaplin Greta Garbo Cary Grant Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have in common
They have never won Academy Awards for their individual achievements
Such flagrant omissions are often cited by critics as evidence of the unfairness of Hollywood's highest prize
Oscar's 60-year history is filled with examples of the film world's highest achievers being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
The latest casualties are directors James L Brooks whose movie ``Broadcast News'' was nominated though he wasn't and Spielberg who was left out in the cold with his ``Empire of the Sun''
Although ``Broadcast News'' won seven major nominations including best picture and three acting categories Brooks was strangely overlooked by the Academy's directing branch
Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its director at least being nominated the chances of the once-favored ``Broadcast News'' to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on April 11 have been significantly reduced
Brooks did better in 1984 when his ``Terms of Endearment'' took the lion's share of Oscars including best picture and director
Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun'' won six nominations this year none of them major and none for director
