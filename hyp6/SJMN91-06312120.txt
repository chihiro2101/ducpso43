TO MOST PEOPLE marathons and vacations are mutually exclusive
Vacation according to Webster means "freedom from any activity
A marathon says the same source is "a footrace of 26 miles 385 yards run over an open course"
But a unique subset has formed people who like to do both at the same time
And to help these folks along companies arrange tours for marathon vacations
Bangkok in November London in April and Stockholm in May
"Skiers have mountain ranges tennis players have resorts why can't a runner take a marathon vacation" said Thorn Gilligan president of Marathon Tours in Boston
"A runner should be able to enjoy a closed city for a day
It's a celebration for the sport as much as a competition"
Gilligan took 5500 people last year on 20 tours to countries from Bermuda to Moscow
In addition to air fare and hotel runners are guaranteed spots in restricted entry races such as the London Marathon
Lebow has run in 32 marathons including London Paris Rome Stockholm Iceland Seoul and Vienna
