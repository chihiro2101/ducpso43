Virginia Thomas is a soft-spoken hard-working daughter of the heartland
A brainy Omaha Neb lawyer who has scaled the sheer cliffs of professional Washington
A churchgoer who invites homeless people out to lunch
Why the fuss over Mrs Supreme Court Nominee
Her critics see her as more than the supportive spouse who'll accompany her husband Clarence through his Senate confirmation hearings which began Tuesday and are likely to run through next week
They see a woman with strong opinions on issues that are bound to come before the court
Some religious rights groups are troubled by her anti-cult activities in light of her former involvement with Lifespring a motivational group
Even the color of her skin is being used to determine the content of Clarence Thomas's character
The fact that she is white has drawn criticism from some blacks who see the marriage as evidence that Clarence Thomas has rejected his roots
