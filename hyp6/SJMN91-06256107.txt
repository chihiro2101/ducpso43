Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee say Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is an evasive witness but no groundswell of opposition to his confirmation seems to be emerging
Several senators were openly skeptical Wednesday over Thomas' insistence that he has no opinion on the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion
If that's so said Sen Paul Simon D-Ill
"he's the only person gathered in the room who does not have an opinion"
Sen Herb Kohl D-Wis added "I'm concerned about his candor his willingness to be forthcoming"
Kohl was today's leadoff questioner as the hearings entered their third day
Two pivotal members of the 14-member committee -- Howell Heflin D-Ala and Arlen Specter R-Pa -- also voiced concern about Thomas' answers
But the panel's traditional third swing vote Dennis DeConcini D-Ariz said Thomas was doing well
Heflin cited the "appearance of a confirmation conversion" and said it may raise questions of Thomas' "integrity and temperament"
And Simon said Thomas' performance thus far "has neither helped him nor hurt him"
Specter blamed fellow committee members more than Thomas in concluding "We really haven't moved very far in the process"
