Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas told the Senate Judiciary Committee today it is "irrelevant" whether he holds any personal opinion on abortion spurring new frustration among the committee's Democrats
But as the hearings' third day got under way no groundswell of opposition to his confirmation seemed to be emerging
Asked several times by Sen Herb Kohl D-Wis about women's right to end their pregnancies Thomas said "Whether or not I have a view is irrelevant"
President Bush asked at a news conference whether Thomas' claim not to have an opinion on abortion is credible answered "That's a question for the Senate to decide"
"He's handling himself very well" the president said
Thomas' answers have frustrated the committee's Democrats who say he is an evasive witness
They also have voiced skepticism about his backing away from stands he took in past writings and speeches
Committee Chairman Joseph Biden D-Del began to show signs of exasperation today during spirited questioning about the nominee's views on "natural law" a theory that certain rights exist independent of written law
At one point Biden accused Thomas of using "tortuous logic"
Later he referred to one of Thomas' replies as "the most unartful dodge I've heard"
After still another Thomas answer Biden said "That's not the question I asked you judge"
He said Thomas had been asked more than 70 questions about his abortion views even though Justice David H Souter was asked only 36 such questions during his confirmation hearings last year
Thomas' opponents believe Republicans Strom Thurmond of South Carolina Hatch Charles Grassley of Iowa Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Hank Brown of Colorado are solid Thomas backers
