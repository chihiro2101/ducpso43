The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo
Such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever for the insurance industry
State Farm Insurance Co expects claims as high as $400 million in South Carolina where it insures one out of every five homes spokesman Jerry Parsons said
The Bloomington Ill-based company is also projecting an additional $100 million in claims from storm damage in North Carolina and Virginia he said
Additionally Nationwide Insurance Co said it expects claims close to $100 million more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida Alabama and Mississippi in 1985
"Our previous all-time high was in 1983 when we paid $165 million in comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia which struck Galveston and Houston
Officials said property damage from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and then instead of heading out to sea veered northwest hitting other population centers including Charlotte NC
Nationwide based in Columbus Ohio is the biggest home and auto insurance in North Carolina where damage was unexpectedly high and is the third-largest insurer in South Carolina
