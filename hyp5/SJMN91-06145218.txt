THE PHOTOGRAPHER caught Winnie Mandela as she left the court after her conviction for kidnapping
She was smiling exuberantly as if she had just won a great victory
Behind her was Nelson Mandela eyes downcast looking stricken and exhausted
That remarkable terrible picture spoke volumes about the drama of South Africa today the human factors and the politics
Most of all it reminded us of the unimaginable burdens borne by one 72-year-old man
In the 15 months since he walked free from prison Nelson Mandela has played the chief role in talks with President FW de Klerk and the white government
He has presided over an African National Congress divided and not yet organized for politics
The radicals in the ANC may well use the trial and conviction of Mrs Mandela to arouse members against Nelson Mandela's policy of peace and negotiation
A more fundamental reason for hope is that FW de Klerk and Nelson Mandela -- and those for whom they speak -- have a common interest in creating a new non-racial South Africa
