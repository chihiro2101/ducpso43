The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England to rubble killing 10 people and injuring 22 eight seriously
It would be one of the outlawed IRA's deadliest attacks on the main British island
Nine marine musicians and one civilian died in the blast which also damaged dozens of nearby homes and could be heard two miles away
The musicians were between the ages of 16 and 20 as are most of the recruits in the school
A police spokesman said forensic experts are still trying to determine with certainty that the explosion was the result of a bomb
Security sources said they believe that at least two IRA "active service" units each composed of four or five members are operating in Britain and continental Europe
One member known as the "Jackal" after the assassin in the Frederick Forsyth novel "The Day of the Jackal" has been eluding the authorities for two years
He has been identified as Patrick Sheehy and has been linked to the IRA's last successful mainland bombing attack -- on an army barracks at Mill Hill in August 1988
Sheehy and another wanted Irishman John Conaghty were linked to an IRA bomb factory in North London that the police stumbled upon last December while in pursuit of a car thief
A search turned up automatic and semiautomatic weapons ammunition 150 pounds of Semtex high explosive and a "hit list" of 100 British political figures and other officials headed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
Friday's explosion occurred about 830 am in a lounge at the Royal Marines School of Music near Deal on the English Channel in the county of Kent
