The scarred battleship Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port where about 3000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors
Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5
Twenty minutes later families started filing aboard the ship exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No 2 gun turret which extends six decks down into the ship
There were 11 survivors inside the turret all on the lowest deck where they were loading powder from the ship's magazines the Navy said
Adm Powell F Carter commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet was there to greet the vessel
John L Fitzgerald a chaplain in a service at the Norfolk Naval Air Station
The Iowa and its sister ships the Missouri New Jersey and Wisconsin were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that he believes the four battleships still "have merit" as weapons in the US arsenal and have a future in the modern Navy
