Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin launched a sweeping purge today that dealt a series of stunning blows to the Communist Party power structure including the ouster of top officials the sealing of party headquarters and the curtailing of party activities
Yeltsin appeared today to be acting at least as an equal with Gorbachev and the two clearly agreed on the replacement of old-guard officials by new reformers
In fact the two leaders reached an agreement that permits each man to assume the other's duties in an emergency such as another coup attempt
Gorbachev threw out his foreign minister Alexander Bessmertnykh and his acting defense minister and named a new head of the KGB
And Yeltsin with Gorbachev's blessing fired the heads of state-owned media
The Moscow City Council meanwhile ordered all Communist Party buildings in the capital sealed and all telephone service to party and KGB buildings cut
About 2000 protesters blockaded the Communist Party headquarters in Moscow declaring they were trying to prevent the removal of documents that might contain evidence linking party members to the coup
Yeltsin who had led the nationwide resistance to the coup announced a ban on Communist Party activities in the Russian republic the army police units of the Interior Ministry and the KGB which for decades helped enforce Communist rule
Some of the many new decrees issued by Yeltsin went beyond the official bounds of his power as Russian Federation president
In his speech before the Russian parliament Gorbachev was compelled to affirm as legitimate the decrees issued by Yeltsin during the three-day coup
It wasn't clear whether the Soviet president had intended to back Yeltsin's latest decrees and he balked at proposals by Russian deputies to outlaw the Communist Party saying it would divide the nation
They wanted to annihilate us and for that they must bear the severe responsibility" the Soviet president said
In Kirghizia Kirghiz President Askar Akaev said the republic would take control of the headquarters of the Kirghiz wing of the Communist Party as well as the local Lenin Museum
In a major blow to the crumbling party the acting head of the KGB today affirmed Yeltsin's ban on Communist Party activity in the security service Tass said
