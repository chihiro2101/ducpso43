President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq and froze the nation's assets in the United States on Thursday while refusing to rule out the use of US troops to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders
The trade embargo bars imports of oil from Iraq which account for 3% to 4% of total US oil supplies officials said
The move also prohibits Iraq from buying US grain and other foodstuffs which represent the other chief element of trade between the two nations
Iraq's "naked aggression" against Kuwait has created "an emergency in the Persian Gulf" Bush said in a speech to the Aspen Institute a nonprofit organization that focuses on global issues
The United States he said would insist on "immediate and unconditional withdrawal" of Iraqi troops
Referring to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Bush declared "We find his behavior intolerable"
The trade embargo represents the strongest international response so far to Iraq's massive invasion of its small and poorly defended neighbor but it stopped short of the military intervention requested by desperate Kuwait officials
But according to Bush Administration sources the Pentagon stepped up air patrols in the Persian Gulf and began moving warships equipment and supplies into the area in a signal to Iraq that the United States would act to halt further aggression
A second executive order signed by the President early Thursday froze Kuwait's assets in the United States a step taken to prevent Iraq from seizing Kuwaiti property
"We expect our friends to stand by us in our time of need" Kuwait's ambassador to the United States Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah said at a Washington news conference
However Iraq's ambassador to Washington Mohammed al Mashat said Iraq had invaded Kuwait in response to a request from the nation's "interim free government"
Iraq's explanation was quickly denounced by the State Department which said Baghdad's claim that its troops moved into Kuwait at that country's request is "patent fraud"
In a related development the State Department confirmed that invading Iraqi troops had rounded up six American oil field workers near the border of Kuwait
At a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who is scheduled to give a speech to the nonprofit Aspen Institute on Sunday Bush said that Secretary of State James A Baker III will discuss the Persian Gulf situation with Soviet officials in Moscow today
In Ulan Bator Mongolia where Baker was on an Asian visit a Baker spokeswoman said that the United States and the Soviet Union plan to issue a joint statement later today condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
Baker at a news conference in Ulan Bator early today said there have been no reports of US casualties in Kuwait and that "the integrity of foreign embassies seems to have been preserved so far"
