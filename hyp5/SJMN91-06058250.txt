ON A recent day the telephone rang in the home of William Wegman
The photographer known for his hilarious portraits of his Weimaraners picked up
In this house man and dogs speak as one
Their relationship is unusually tender
One need only listen while Wegman murmurs to Fay Ray and Battina her 1 1/2-year-old daughter
On Valentine's Day for example he said "I'll take them out and play with them longer"
"But I don't want to be known as a dog zombie" said Wegman who did go to the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show without the dogs
When Bill leaves Batty howls" said Andrea Beeman an assistant to Wegman
Their home is one floor of a former Orthodox synagogue on the Lower East Side of Manhattan
"I'd never heard of Weimaraners" said the artist who was born 47 years ago in Longmeadow Mass
Wegman had never photographed dogs before but Man Ray was a perfect subject
Had he been a different breed he would have been a "character actor" Wegman said "like Lassie"
