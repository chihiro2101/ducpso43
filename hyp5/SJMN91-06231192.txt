NIXON disco LSD --
it's no surprise really that those '70s rejects have staged comebacks
The flaky avant-garde artist whose idea of music was to scream inside a plastic bag while John Lennon played guitar
The Evil One who single-handedly killed the Beatles and destroyed her husband's talent and ambition
Who could possibly regard her as anything other than a crackpot and a public menace
Well let's see there's party rockers the B52s and cult singer Lene Lovich -- successful critically acclaimed musicians who credit Ono's music as an influence
There's the Whitney Museum of Art which exhibited Ono's artwork last year -- one of the 10 museum shows she has had around the world
There's also the American Film Institute which Ono says is staging an international tour of her experimental films
And Ono's record label -- "they want to put out all my songs in a kind of CD box or something" Ono says
"I'm used to sort of knocking the door rather than having the door opened and having to cope with entering it" Ono says during a telephone interview
She's speaking from the New York office of Bag One Arts the company Ono founded to promote Lennon's art and image
Since his death in 1980 Ono has steadily kept Lennon products coming out the albums "Milk and Honey" and "Menlove Avenue" and the 4-CD boxed set "The John Lennon Collection"
the book "Skywriting by Word of Mouth" a collection of Lennon's unpublished writings
Lennon's art which Ono says was his main interest in his final years
Every year hopefully give a new product and share it with the fans" Ono says
The 10-year promise ended with last year's year-long celebration of Lennon's 50th birthday
Ono 57 has been going into a recording studio every day to work on the proposed boxed-set of her music
She continues to produce art and recently had a museum exhibit in Iceland
She began doing performance art in the early '60s long before the form was legitimized by art critics and government grants
Ono still lives in the Dakota apartment house in New York the site of Lennon's murder by a crazed fan
Ono was born in Tokyo -- her name means "Ocean Child" -- and came with her family to the United States in 1936
Ono lived with her family in San Francisco and New York until the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor forced them to return home
Others say Lennon used his relationship with Ono as an escape from things in his life that he felt were controlling him -- such as the Beatles
Many of the books that have been written about Lennon and the Beatles especially Albert Goldman's loathing portrait of Lennon have been painful to Ono
