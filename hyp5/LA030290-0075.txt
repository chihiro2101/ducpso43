Try to think of Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon less as a "happening" which it surely is or a world-class athletic event which it may become but is not now
Look at it more as a moving advertising opportunity human billboards running 262 miles through the city on live television
With that kind of exposure to a potential 12 million Southern Californians it's no wonder that in only five years the L A Marathon has become the best-marketed slickest most modern and sponsor-driven of the world's major marathons
It may not be an overstatement that the L A Marathon is one of the country's best-marketed sports events of any kind
Massive marketing campaigns and major sponsors lining up for a seat on the money wagon do not make L A an elite race give it prestige or attract the world's best runners
And that may yet transform this race if -- as marathon President Bill Burke said this week -- the total purse of $202520 is increased by $100000 next year and significantly more money is added for appearance fees to lure top athletes
According to Will Kern director of Times special events this year's marathon has received almost $500000 worth of donated advertising space
The race's marketing-oriented philosophy can be traced to Burke and marathon Vice President Marie Patrick
According to Mary Reiling national event manager for AT&ampT the LA Marathon's "sponsor-friendly" approach is a big incentive
For example AT&ampT is buying commercial time on Channel 13's broadcast and Channel 13 is providing updates on the AT&ampT Friendship Cup an international race within the race
