It's a dog's life for Bill McFadden

McFadden and his wife Taffe run their dog handling business in Campbell and do it primarily for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings
Taffe McFadden a Vancouver British Columbia native who has been involved in dog handling since she was a child specializes in poodles
