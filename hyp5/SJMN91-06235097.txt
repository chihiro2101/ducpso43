President Mikhail Gorbachev today furiously denounced the "crude and crafty" plotters who briefly overthrew him but said the failed power grab by hard-liners could prove to be an "enormous opportunity" to further his democratic reforms
Gorbachev moving to tighten his newly regained grip on power and punish the coup leaders declared at a news conference that the Soviet Union had survived "the most difficult trial" of his six-year-old reform movement
At the news conference -- Gorbachev's first since the coup against him collapsed on Wednesday -- the 60-year-old leader condemned the takeover as being against "the people against democracy"
Earlier he told reporters he would have killed himself rather than submit to any forced arrangement with the coup leaders
"I said I wouldn't make any deals" he said then "
Gorbachev detailed his purge of coup leaders including Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov
He named a new acting KGB chief interior minister and defense minister and said he would do everything to "drive out the reactionary forces from the Communist Party"
Gorbachev pledged cooperation with Russian republic President Boris Yeltsin but said he had no plans to leave the Communist Party
When asked if Yeltsin now had more power than he did Gorbachev said "We have been bound together by the situation"
At his news conference Gorbachev made a point of publicly praising Yeltsin whose folk-hero stature was enhanced during the coup as he rallied hundreds of thousands of his supporters to resist
Before dawn today Gorbachev flew back to Moscow from the Crimea where he had been confined to his summer home during his brief ouster
The Soviet president who was reported to have slept for a few hours in his dacha outside Moscow after returning from the Crimea arrived at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport unannounced under heavy security
Gorbachev said his captors cut off all communication and that his only source of news during the coup had been from foreign broadcasts including the BBC and Voice of America received on a makeshift radio set up by his personal guards
