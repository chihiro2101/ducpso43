PEOPLE in this picture-postcard town of Victorian houses and clean streets don't care what Jay Leno or the polls or the Democrats or disgruntled Republicans have been saying about Dan Quayle
Despite the fact that President Bush's health problems have made the vice president a national preoccupation to people here he's just Danny Quayle from Polk Street -- a really nice guy from a really nice family that runs the local newspaper
He is the most important person ever to come out of this town and even as the world considers his fitness for the presidency Huntington is celebrating his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the Premiere Dan Quayle Memorabilia Exhibit
To those who say Quayle does not merit his own exhibition Quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is after all the vice president of the United States
"We're preserving history" says David Schenkel the exhibition coordinator
Relatives former classmates and longtime neighbors of Quayle have donated yearbooks report cards poems letters his Little League uniform a coffee cup he drank from a chair he once stood on during the 1988 presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched wrote signed or posed for
The vice president's mother Corinne donated a lock of his baby hair
The 1972 Indianapolis 500 queen produced a picture of Quayle then an aide to Indiana Gov Edgar Whitcomb accompanying her to the race
And a former housekeeper turned in a 20-year-old piece of carpeting she saved from one of Quayle's floors
The exhibition which runs through May 20 was put together by the Dan Quayle Commemorative Foundation a sort of fan-club-turned-archive devoted to documenting the life and times of the nation's 44th and they say least-understood vice president
They defend the relatively young age of Quayle who turned 44 in February ("All he needs is a little seasoning")
"He's not the fool that the talk show hosts think he is" says Dottie Watson president of the Republican Women of Huntington County
Hayden Schenkel chairman of the Huntington County Democratic Party and a distant cousin of David Schenkel says "Some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally became president of the United States
There is Dan Quayle with his Vacation Bible School class Dan Quayle with the high school golf team Dan Quayle at 5 or 6 years of age with Sharon McEachern when they were named king and queen of the swim festival at the Fort Wayne Country Club
