Orange County's Iranian community launched an ambitious effort Sunday to collect half a million dollars in money medicine tents blankets and sleeping bags for hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless people in earthquake-ravaged Iran
Representatives of 11 Iranian professional and community groups manned tables near William R Mason Regional Park where contributors dropped off supplies pledged other aid or made financial contributions
Organizers said they hope to raise at least $500000 in donations
"We'll do this as long as it takes" said organizer Bijan Kian
The 50 organizers Sunday wore black armbands expressing their grief for those killed injured and left homeless in what they described as that country's worst earthquake of the century
In Iran rescue efforts were hampered Sunday as the strongest aftershock yet jarred the already severely damaged rice-growing region of Rasht 120 miles northwest of Tehran
The new shock with a magnitude of 57 toppled the few still-standing structures and caused mudslides that temporarily closed the road linking Rasht with other destruction zones in Zanjan province
The group set up the collection point in front of William R Mason Regional Park on property belonging to the City of Irvine
The group -- the Orange County Committee for Iran Earthquake Relief -- has set up a special account at Capital Bank in Santa Ana
at California State Fullerton has set up a booth in Parking Lot C near State College Boulevard and Nutwood Avenue
The donations will be forwarded to the Red Cross or they may be sent directly to the Red Cross PO Box 11364 Santa Ana CA
