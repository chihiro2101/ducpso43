Lucille Ball whose death Wednesday morning at the age of 77 will be the most widely and deeply felt show-business loss in recent memory was the movies' greatest gift to television
It turned out to be one of Sam Goldwyn's finest and most prophetic hours when he signed her as one of his Goldwyn Girls to appear in "Roman Scandals" with Eddie Cantor in 1933
She had had bit parts in two earlier films but "Roman Scandals" was the one that gave her a firmer foothold on the slippery slopes of a Hollywood career
She perfected her matchless craft as a comedienne in dozens of films including three of Fred Astaire's and one of the Marx Brothers ("Room Service")
But in those years Lucy was refining her enduring endearing public image as a perky saucy woman who was likelier (at least in the early days) to end up with the hero's funny pal than with the hero himself
To look at the "I Love Lucy" reruns today as everybody does again and again is to realize how superbly professional they are
Today many sitcoms still use the three-camera technique shooting in front of live audiences that Desi Arnaz pioneered
Her foils -- Desi himself Vivian Vance and William Frawley -- were superb farceurs themselves but Lucy was the dynamo that made it all work
