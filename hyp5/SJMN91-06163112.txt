Mount Pinatubo the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six centuries of quiet is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with force comparable to the Mount St Helens explosion a US government scientist said Monday
"I think we could see a major explosive eruption any time" said Peter Lipman a volcanologist at the US Geological Survey office in Menlo Park
Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April when it first stirred
A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11500 feet above the volcano today spreading ash over a six-mile radius the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said
If it does erupt the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base he said
Also in peril are the 350000 residents of Angeles City where the air base is located about 50 miles north of Manila
Mount Pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the "Ring of Fire" on the Pacific coasts of Asia and the Americas
(These volcanoes -- including Mount Lassen in Shasta County and Mount Rainier and Mount St Helens in Washington all in the Cascade Range -- arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath another)
Other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985
