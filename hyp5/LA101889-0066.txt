Tuesday's earthquake the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the San Francisco quake on April 18 1906 came in a place that had been identified by scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in Northern California within the next 30 years
The epicenter of the temblor eight miles east-northeast of the city of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz Mountains was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on June 27 1988 and Aug 8 1989
The US Geological Survey in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake probability in California said there was a 30% chance of another 65-magnitude earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018
The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern California in the same period but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in Northern California in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake
A period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go and during this time scientists said Tuesday night pressure was probably building up in the southern neighboring segment of the San Andreas which had not slipped as much
Thomas Heaton the Geological Survey scientist in charge of the agency's Pasadena field office said that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen as "preshocks" of the Tuesday's 69 temblor
He said "foreshocks" would not be the proper term since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake struck
But he joined Caltech scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as 59 magnitude should be expected and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months
After both the 1987 and the 1988 earthquakes in the Santa Cruz mountains the state Office of Emergency Services and the US Geological Survey issued warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes ranging up to 65 magnitude within the next few days in the vicinity
The trouble was the area was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the Bay Area on the San Andreas Fault
The San Andreas the longest and best-known earthquake fault in California extends from Point Arena in Mendocino County to the Salton Sea
Although Tuesday's quake was powerful Waverly Person chief of the National Earthquake Information Service in Golden Colo cautioned that at 69 magnitude it should be considered only a "strong" shock not a "major" one as a quake in the 70 to 79 range would be classified or a "great" one as a quake of 80 or above would be
Person and others in the Geological Survey warned Tuesday night that the probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than Tuesday's will strike in Southern California sometime in the next three decades
Jim Dewey a research geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center said preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about 10 miles deep and that the quake rupture extended about 30 miles south down the fault from the epicenter
Meanwhile a New Mexico scientist who studies tidal forces supported by two eyewitnesses said Tuesday night that at a private lecture in San Francisco on Oct 10 he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or about Oct 16
