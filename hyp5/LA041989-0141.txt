A fiery explosion in a giant gun turret rocked the refitted battleship Iowa on maneuvers in the Atlantic today killing at least 47 sailors and injuring an undetermined number the Pentagon said
Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard said the explosion may have resulted from the blast of a 110-pound gunpowder bag used to fire shells that weigh more than a ton a distance of up to 23 miles
"We assume it was a powder bag" Howard said in Brussels
Another spokesman said at least 47 crewmen were killed in the explosion that ripped through the turret when one of the giant guns was being fired during a training exercise about 330 miles northeast of Puerto Rico
The aircraft carrier Coral Sea steamed to the scene sending out helicopters to land supplies and medical crews on the ship
The Iowa headed toward Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Puerto Rico
Chairman Adm William Crowe were informed of the incident while attending a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels
