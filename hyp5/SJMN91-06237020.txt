"And now for a bit of relaxation" Yeltsin said interrupting Gorbachev's speech "
Gorbachev who has insisted the party is still capable of reform stammered a bit and then said "Boris Nikolayevich Boris Nikolayevich   "
Yeltsin who clearly relished his emotional and political control of the parliament session also played a critical role in selecting the new heads of the KGB the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry police which until now have been bastions of opposition to reform
Flouting protocol Yeltsin was the first to announce the appointments while speaking at a mass rally Friday morning outside KGB headquarters
Former Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin will head the KGB Gen Yevgeny Shaposhnikov the air force chief becomes defense minister and former Russian Interior Minister Victor Barannikov will be the union's interior minister

Bessmertnykh reacted with "bitterness" according to the Tass news agency and claimed that he had refused to join the conservative uprising even though coup leader and former KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov had told him "We need a liberal among us"
Across the country Communist Party leaders who opposed the coup quit their party posts and some who supported it such as Latvian party leader Alfred Rubiks were arrested
