The Conservatives' choice of Major a Thatcher protege came after a battle pitting him against two other contenders for the party leadership former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
The three-way race took shape last week when Thatcher stunned by Heseltine's strong showing in the first-round voting for party leader resigned
In the secret second-round balloting among the 372 Tory members of the House of Commons on Tuesday Major got 185 votes -- two shy of the total he needed for an outright victory
But as party members began preparing themselves for a Thursday runoff between Major and Heseltine the runner-up both Heseltine with 131 votes and Hurd with 56 threw their support to Major

When the results of Tuesday's vote were announced about 620 pm both Heseltine and Hurd said that they would vote for Major in the scheduled third runoff ballot on Thursday and advised their supporters to do the same
Party leaders however waived the third ballot -- which was expected to be unanimous -- and Major was declared party leader

The prime minister had picked Major from among "backbenchers" -- those who are not party leaders -- as someone to watch several years ago and regarded him aides said as "a man of the people"
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock who likely will face Major in the next national election immediately labeled him "more of the same" in the Thatcher mold
