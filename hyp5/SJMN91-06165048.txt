Three major new eruptions rocked Mount Pinatubo late Wednesday night and early today forcing another emergency evacuation of Clark Air Base and increasing fears of even more violent explosions from the long-dormant volcano in the days ahead
Mudslides also threatened after fierce thunderstorms and lightning Wednesday illuminated afternoon skies eerily darkened by giant volcanic clouds
As much as two inches of coarse gray ash and fist-sized pieces of pumice fell along a 50-mile stretch southwest of the volcano
An eruption this morning caused an earthquake so strong it "sent seismograph needles off the chart" and registered 60 miles south in Manila said Jessie Daligdig a government geologist
Villagers tied wet kerchiefs on their faces and used rakes shovels and pieces of wood to push the blanket of snow-like ash from roads
Two people have been reported killed so far a Filipino serving in the US Navy who died in a traffic accident on an ash-slick road and a Filipino boy reported to have died after inhaling sulfuric fumes that began to seep from the volcano last weekend
The initial explosions on Mount Pinatubo at 851 am Wednesday sent a 10-mile-high mushroom cloud of swirling ash and rock fragments into the skies over Clark Air Base forcing the Air Force to evacuate hundreds of American volunteers who had stayed behind to guard it and to tend sensitive communications equipment
President Corazon Aquino helicoptered to refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to Manila for an Independence Day rally and parade at Luneta Park
Raymundo Punongbayan director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said scientists could not estimate how much magma was still pent up inside Mount Pinatubo but said more eruptions at least as violent are expected within the next three days
