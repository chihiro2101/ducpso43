The camera pans across the ornate furnishings of President Mikhail Gorbachev's Kremlin office then moves in for a tight shot of three men hunched over a coffee table conferring in the low voices of conspirators

"It's highly implausible but not to be excluded that Gorbachev himself agreed to a withdrawal thinking he'd show them they still needed him" said Norman Naimark director of Stanford's Center for Russian and East European Studies
