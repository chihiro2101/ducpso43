Mount Pinatubo rumbled today with explosions that hurled ash and gas more than 12 miles high and a typhoon brought heavy rain that could unleash tons of debris from the jagged slopes
Seven explosions were recorded from the 4800-foot tropical volcano today and scientists said more were expected
Typhoon Yunya packing 80 mph winds slammed into the eastern coast of Luzon island which includes Mount Pinatubo early in the day
Still heavy rains churned up by the typhoon drenched Manila and the provinces near the volcano raising fears of mudflows that could bury whole towns up to 25 miles away
Meanwhile President Corazon Aquino dismissed a British newspaper report that Americans had warned her of possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages nuclear storage sites at Clark Air Base abandoned Monday by nearly 15000 Americans
The US military began flying home hundreds of the 28000 Americans who crowded onto Subic Bay Naval Base as a bizarre tropical blizzard of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base Friday during a third day of increasingly violent eruptions of Mount Pinatubo
Raymundo Punongbayan director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said Friday's blasts were part of a single eruption the largest since Mount Pinatubo awoke Sunday from its 600-year slumber
A British newspaper the Guardian reported Thursday that the Americans declared a nuclear alert at Clark late Wednesday and informed governments in Manila and Hong Kong that "a nuclear accident in the region was possible"
