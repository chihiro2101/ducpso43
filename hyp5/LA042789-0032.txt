Presidents famous actors television executives neighbors and tourists all had their memories
Some had known her most had not
In form their sentiments ranged from flowers to telegrams to hand-lettered signs
Through them all ran a single constant thread
They all said they loved Lucy and they'll miss her
From former President and Mrs Ronald Reagan "Lucille Ball was a gifted comedienne who brought laughter to millions the world over
Her red hair her antics on the screen her timing and her zest for life made her an American institution"
Reagan's successor extended his "deepest sympathy" to Miss Ball's family and called her a "legendary figure"
So did the world" President Bush said in a statement
Lucille Ball had last appeared in public in March at the Academy Awards ceremony
Her co-presenter was Bob Hope who a few hours after her death said simply "God has her now but thanks to television we'll have her forever"
About 20 people gathered on the sidewalk some snapping photographs of the home and of the dozen television crews standing outside
In Boston comedian Lily Tomlin said "It's a sad day for me
Burns likened Miss Ball's death to that of his wife Gracie Allen "
