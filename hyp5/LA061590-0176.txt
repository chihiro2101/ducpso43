A flash flood sent a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high rampaging through hill communities along the Ohio River killing at least 10 people and leaving dozens missing authorities said today
Two creeks just outside this Ohio River village of 4300 residents overflowed when thunderstorms dumped about 4 inches of rain Thursday night in about an hour
"It created a wall of water" said Jim Williams of the Ohio Emergency Management Agency
The raging waters knocked homes off their foundations and washed away a bar filled with people in Shadyside an Appalachian foothill town
The Shadyside Fire Department set up a command center at the Jefferson Elementary School to coordinate rescue efforts
Shadyside -- about 10 miles south of Wheeling WVa -- is in Belmont County a mostly hilly rural area in eastern Ohio
Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek which flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River
