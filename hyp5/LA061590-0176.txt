Two creeks just outside this Ohio River village of 4300 residents overflowed when thunderstorms dumped about 4 inches of rain Thursday night in about an hour
"It created a wall of water" said Jim Williams of the Ohio Emergency Management Agency
"The problem we're having right now is accounting for the people we can't find"
Gov Richard F Celeste declared a state of emergency and surveyed the area
"You're talking miles and miles of country roads that haven't been gotten to yet" she said
Belmont County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Judy Phillips said a Shadyside bar full of people was washed away when water caved in the back wall
Two people were accounted for she said
