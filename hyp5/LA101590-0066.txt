Leonard Bernstein the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist composer conductor and teacher and was as well the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment
Bernstein known and beloved by the world as "Lenny" died at 615 pm in the presence of his son Alexander and physician Kevin M Cahill who said the cause of death was complications of progressive lung failure
On Cahill's advice the conductor had announced Tuesday that he would retire
Cahill said progressive emphysema complicated by a pleural tumor and a series of lung infections had left Bernstein too weak to continue working
In recent months Bernstein canceled performances with increasing frequency
His last conducting appearance was at Tanglewood Mass on Aug 19
Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces while conducting from the piano
He etched other niches in history by composing the indelible "West Side Story" and teaching a generation about classical music via the innovative television series "Omnibus"
Exhibiting remarkable talent and expertise in four areas that most artists wish they possessed in merely one Bernstein still might have remained an obscure musician without the unique theatrical flair that dominated his personal as well as professional life
With it he became a personality well known even to people who never bought a ticket to a musical performance or watched a serious television show
The dervish persona including his upstart gymnastics on the podium never lessened throughout his long life in the spotlight
He made classical music understandable and palatable to the masses
And he lifted popular music to a higher plane infusing performers and listeners with his manic joy in creating tonal sound
"Some conductors mellow with age" commented Times music critic Martin Bernheimer when Bernstein conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic at UCLA in 1986
Describing the conductor in the same concert Bernheimer referred to him as "the shrugging jumping sighing soaring gushing crouching rocking rolling bounding bobbing leaping jiggling stabbing hunching bumping grinding and grunting maestro in excelsis"
Critics also were quick to agree that had his envied and often-criticized showmanship masked lazy sloppy or inept musicianship Bernstein could never have remained an internationally sought-after conductor for five decades
He knew what he was doing and the musicians he accompanied wrote for conducted or lectured to and taught admired him as one of their own
Louis Bernstein (so-named because his maternal grandmother insisted) was born Aug 25 1918 in Lawrence Mass to two Russian Jewish immigrants
His father Samuel Joseph Bernstein was an entrepreneur of women's hair care products and a Talmudic scholar
His mother Jennie Resnick Bernstein who survives him said her son always had an ear for music
When his kindergarten teacher asked "Louis Bernstein" to stand up he remained seated and looked around the room to see who shared his last name
Bernstein changed his name legally at age 16 when he got his first driver's license
When Bernstein was 10 a divorcing aunt stored her old upright piano with his parents and the boy who used to play at the windowsill became fascinated with it
He asked for lessons and soon was playing better than his teacher a neighbor's daughter who charged $1 a lesson
By age 12 he was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music and had determined despite his father's objections that music -- at that point playing the piano -- would be his career
Bernstein's stunning instinctive talents for sight-reading remembering complicated scores and improvisation became evident as he played and altered classical jazz and popular music
He produced his own shows and versions of "The Mikado" and "Carmen" and performed as piano soloist with his school orchestra and the State Symphony Orchestra
He reveled in music while excelling in athletics and the classical subjects taught at the 300-year-old Boston Latin School
At Harvard University Bernstein studied piano and composition but developed a serious interest in composing only after meeting American composer Aaron Copland
Invited to a dance recital in New York Bernstein sat in the balcony next to a man he did not recognize
Invited afterward to a post-recital birthday party for Copland Bernstein commandeered the piano and played Copland's "Piano Variations"
Copland introduced Bernstein to several composers and got him his first job -- transcribing music for the publisher Boosey and Hawkes
Ironically Copland subsequently urged the torn Bernstein to make conducting rather than composing or even piano playing his career
Conducting emerged as a possibility to Bernstein that same year -- 1937 his sophomore year at Harvard -- when he met the Greek conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos during the maestro's visit to campus
Bernstein was told by the Koussevitzkys that he should visit Artur Rodzinsky newly appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic at his Stockbridge Conn farm
The effort became Deutsche Grammaphon's all-time best-selling record and prompted Will Crutchfield to write in the New York Times that Bernstein was in a class with Giuseppe Verdi
