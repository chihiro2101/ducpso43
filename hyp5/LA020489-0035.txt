In its renewed investigation of defense secretary nominee John Tower the FBI is checking allegations that Tower was recently involved in an episode of public drunkenness sources said Friday -- allegations that call into question his insistence that he has no current drinking problem
Tower testified in confirmation hearings earlier this week that his problems with alcohol are behind him
But a senior member of the Armed Services Committee who asked not to be identified said Friday that the new allegation if true suggests that the former Texas senator's drinking problem "may be ongoing" and that his confirmation remains in doubt
The charge received Wednesday by the committee was very specific giving the date and place of the alleged incident and was made by an informant who identified herself a knowledgeable source said
The episode allegedly occurred within the last year at the Monocle a Capitol Hill restaurant frequented by lawmakers lobbyists and congressional aides
Two other allegations under scrutiny by the FBI's special inquiries unit which is working around the clock this weekend on the Tower matter involve assertions of another incident of public intoxication and of a recent affair with an unidentified Dallas woman
If the new charges should be verified by the FBI Tower's nomination is doomed an authoritative committee source said
FBI agents spent two hours at the Monocle Friday interviewing the owner
But one source said that no one on the staff contradicted Tower's statement that in recent years he has moderated his once-heavy drinking and now drinks only an occasional glass of wine
On Thursday the Armed Services Committee had been set to approve the Tower nomination but Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga) abruptly canceled the vote because of the new charges which he referred immediately to FBI Director William S Sessions
The bureau already had conducted an extensive background investigation of Tower a 24-year Senate veteran who headed the Armed Services panel from 1981 to 1985
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis) said that the controversy has already hobbled Tower's ability to lead the Pentagon effectively
