The space shuttle Discovery brought a thundering end to years of frustration when it blasted off Tuesday to extend human vision to the very edge of the universe
The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles where its crew today will ever-so-carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope billed as the finest optical instrument ever created a $15-billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye
Seven years behind schedule the telescope will be deployed by astronaut Steven Hawley an astronomer on a day that many scientists were beginning to doubt they would ever see
"It's been long and frustrating" conceded Edward Weiler program scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who was visibly shaken by the launch
"Every astronomer" he said softly "should take today off"
The launch marked the beginning of an era -- some say a revolution -- in the exploration of the universe
"After 12 years" astronomer Eric Chaisson of the Space Telescope Science Institute said with a sigh "it has finally left the Earth"
High above the haze of the Earth's atmosphere the Hubble is expected to produce images 10 times sharper than even the largest telescopes on Earth today
After the deployment engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center will begin the tedious process of activating the telescope
In about seven days the Hubble should snap its first picture -- what astronomers call "first light" for the telescope -- but it will be primarily an engineering exercise and the image is not expected to amount to much
"The stars may be so out of focus they look like doughnuts" said Caltech's James Westphal principal scientist for the telescope's wide field camera
This is the second flight for Charles F Bolden Jr 43 the pilot and mission specialists Bruce McCandless 52 and Kathryn D Sullivan 38
