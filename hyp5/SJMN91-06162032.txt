Thousands of Americans piled into cars and buses with dogs cats and duffel bags and left Clark Air Base today after scientists warned that the eruption of a nearby volcano could turn catastrophic
The decision to evacuate one of the largest overseas US military bases was made early today after searing gases ash and rock shot out of 4795-foot Mount Pinatubo on Sunday at speeds of up to 60 mph
The volcano about 10 miles west of the air base came to life last week after six centuries of dormancy
No casualties have been reported but experts are concerned that a major eruption could occur soon
Gases ash and molten rock continued to pour out of the mountain today enshrouding it in thick gray clouds of ash and steam that rose 12000 feet
The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said it detected rhythmic ground movements today that indicated molten material was rising to the surface of the craters
Institute Director Raymundo Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo was in the "early eruptive stage" and "after that we will have bigger ones"
Rains fell across the area Sunday night and officials warned residents in the lush green lowlands west of the mountain to move to higher ground to escape mud flows
Air Force spokesman Lt Col Ron Rand announced the evacuation in a 5 am broadcast over the US military's Far East Network
An hour later the first vehicles began rolling out of Clark for the US-run Subic Bay naval base where the 14500 troops dependents and civilian employees will be housed until the danger passes
Mount Unzen and Mount Pinatubo belong to the "Ring of Fire" that circles the Pacific where shifting plates of the Earth's crust push against each other triggering periodic volcanic eruptions and earthquakes
