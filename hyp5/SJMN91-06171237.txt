The women's field for Sunday's San Francisco Marathon appears mighty impressive to race President Rich Nichols who didn't have to do much coaxing to get the highly ranked women to enter
"This year's women's field is interesting because most of the competitors called us" said Nichols
The Olympic trials scheduled for January have made Nichols' job much easier this year
Most top-ranked US women are looking for any summer-time marathon in which to run and the San Francisco version offers excellent conditions
The weather however makes it one of the few enticing races held from June to September
Last year's winner Janis Klecker of Minnetonka Minn is entered
Julie Shea-Graw of Raleigh NC and Jane Welzel of Fort Collins Colo
Welzel is the 1990 national champion Gibbons has won 26 marathons Lahane is a former cross-country national champion and Aiello twice has finished second in San Francisco
