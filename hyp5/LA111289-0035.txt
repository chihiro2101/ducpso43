One year after his election Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted He has become dull
His coming-out party last Sunday was a true test of his new ability to not make news
He went on "Meet the Press"
This was no small thing
During his entire campaign for the vice presidency Quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows
He didn't appear on "Meet the Press" or "This Week With David Brinkley" or "Face the Nation"
And he didn't do so because back then he was making too much news
His every slip his every gaffe his every goof was news
A lot of people feel Quayle is just too inexperienced for a do-nothing job" Jay Leno once said
So when Quayle got to Washington he got there with one goal Support the President and make himself a very small target
Stay out of the headlines and give no reason for anyone to dump him in 1992
"We had asked him on the show a number of times" Christie Basham senior producer of "Meet the Press" told me "but he always declined
We renewed our request and then after saying he would not do the show he changed his mind and said he would
It was the 42nd anniversary of the show and we wanted someone above and beyond the usual guest"
And it says something about Dan Quayle's reputation that he would be considered "above and beyond" the usual guest
As George Bush once joked about his duties as vice president "You die I fly"
And now was the time for Quayle to go on "Meet the Press" and show everybody just how right George Bush had been
Quayle's questioners were David Broder of the Washington Post and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker both of whom stuck to serious questions
