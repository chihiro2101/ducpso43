Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy the United States to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35000 people the State Department said in Washington
The aid would be accepted through the American Red Cross and other US humanitarian organizations deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said
"We want to be helpful without regard for our political differences with Iran" he said
There have been only rare instances of US-Iranian cooperation since the two countries broke diplomatic relations a decade ago
The United States holds Iran partly responsible for the continued detention of American hostages by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon
Boucher said Iran told the US government that private donor agencies should contact the Iranian Red Crescent a humanitarian group that is the conduit for all outside assistance
Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries -- including Iraq -- but excluded Israel and South Africa
The Islamic Republic News Agency said 6000 people were pulled from rubble and airlifted from the stricken Gilan and Zanjan provinces to hospitals
