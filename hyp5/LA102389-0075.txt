Although they are a continent apart the cities of Charleston SC and San Francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time
They are the scenes of two of the century's costliest back-to-back natural disasters Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake
There are dramatic similarities and profound differences in the ways these two cities were affected and altered in the first week after they were ravaged by two powerful forces of nature -- one that angrily swept across the land from the sea and one that violently rumbled beneath the earth
"From the standpoint of compassion of all the people in America we can feel the hurt that the San Francisco area is going through the most" Charleston Mayor Joseph P Riley Jr said Sunday one month after Hugo hit
"We know it means at best the disruption of normal life for some time and at worst the loss of life"
Unlike earthquakes hurricanes can be tracked by planes and radar their paths predicted with sufficient certainty for those in harm's way to secure property and to flee
Still at least 28 deaths in the Carolinas are blamed on Hugo while at least 60 deaths have been attributed to the Bay Area earthquake
Hugo 500 miles across with winds topping 175 mph left virtually every street and every neighborhood littered with storm debris and 80% of the city's buildings with some degree of damage
Five days after the storm many city residents remained inconvenienced most without electricity many without safe drinking water
Restaurants in Chinatown North Beach and along Fillmore Street were crowded Saturday night
"Their streets were immediately passable" said Charleston Police Chief Ruben Greenberg
And a week after the hurricane Charleston -- which like San Francisco has a tourism-based economy -- was still trying to cope with mountains of broken trees and shattered roofs
By Sunday tourists and tour buses could be seen outside hotels near Fisherman's Wharf and at other locations favored by visitors
Citywide Charleston had 68 buildings collapse compared to 60 buildings destroyed just in San Francisco's Marina District
Millions were watching the pregame World Series program when the earthquake struck and instantly word was out that there had been a disaster
