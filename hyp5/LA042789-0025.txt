Lucille Ball the leggy showgirl model and B-grade movie queen whose pumpkin hair and genius for comedy made her an icon of television died early Wednesday a week after undergoing emergency heart surgery
The co-creator and star of "I Love Lucy" a product of TV's Golden Age that continues via syndication to be viewed by millions around the world was 77 and died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of a ruptured abdominal aorta
Known simply as "Lucy" to four decades of smitten television fans she had undergone surgery at Cedars-Sinai on April 18 to replace part of her aorta and aortic valve and had recovered from the 6 1/2-hour operation to a point where she was eating and even walking around her hospital room
Hospital spokesman Ronald Wise said the rupture occurred in a portion of the aorta the main heart artery far from where the operation was performed
She suffered a complete heart failure at 5 am and 47 minutes of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless Wise said
"There was nothing to indicate this would happen" Wise said
"The heart itself apparently was not involved in Miss Ball's sudden death"
Since last week's surgery fans had flooded the hospital with thousands of get-well cards sent via telegram and even facsimile machine
Hospital officials said it was the largest outpouring they had ever seen
Miss Ball was a tough-talking woman who had used her stardom and show business savvy to become with her then-husband the late Desi Arnaz head of one of Hollywood's major studios Desilu
Despite her business acumen she remained the unquestioned queen of television comedy
From her star-struck childhood through her struggles as a wisecracking movie actress in the 1930s and '40s to the television career that made her a legend Miss Ball's life was in the best show business tradition of rags to riches
Almost humbly she liked to say she owed her enormous success not so much to talent but to a magical combination of guts and good supporting players
Her greatest achievements she always would add were not any milestones in her career but ranked somewhere under the birth of her two children Lucie in 1951 and Desi Jr two years later
"I am not funny" Ball told an interviewer for Rolling Stone magazine in 1983
It was "I Love Lucy" which premiered on CBS on Oct 15 1951 that earned Miss Ball her niche in television history
The 30-minute comedy starred Miss Ball and the Cuban-born Arnaz as the wacky Lucy Ricardo and her conga-playing husband Ricky
The show was a weekly dash into absurdity that boasted the biggest television audience of its time -- of almost any time
In creating the show Miss Ball and Arnaz -- who died in 1986 -- set a pattern of television that was to be repeated in decades to come
They filmed the programs in front of a live audience and in doing so invented the popular and financially rewarding rerun
The show was so popular during the 1950s that it literally stopped the nation every Monday night from 9 pm to 930 pm
In fact nighttime shoppers became so scarce in Chicago that the mammoth Marshall Field department store posted a sign that read "We Love Lucy too so from now on we will be open Thursday night instead of Monday
" When presidential candidate Adlai E Stevenson interrupted the show once for a political message he was flooded with angry mail
Even a charge that Miss Ball was a Communist made by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952 failed to dent her popularity
The charges based on her registering to vote as a Communist in 1936 were dropped when Miss Ball explained she had done so only to please her ailing grandfather
A phenomenal 40 million viewers watched the antics each week as Lucy would always try to outwit Ricky
With their best friends and landlords Fred and Ethel Mertz played by veterans William Frawley and Vivian Vance as the perfect foils the Ricardos found themselves mired in situations that frequently were rowdy and always ridiculous
A generation of Americans grew to recap their favorite Lucy episodes plot twist by crazy twist
There was the time Lucy schemed her way onto Ricky's television show to do a commercial for a vegetable drink with a high alcoholic content and got hilariously tipsy during the many retakes
Then there was the time she threw in two packages of yeast while baking homemade bread and ended up pinned against the wall of her Manhattan kitchen by a monster loaf
And there was the time Lucy and Ethel trying to impress their New York friends with the ultimate souvenir from a trip to Hollywood pried loose the cement block containing John Wayne's footprints from in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater
Week after week Lucy would find herself trapped in a vat of laundry starch locked in a meat freezer or lost on a subway with a loving cup stuck on her head
"An extraordinary discipline and intuitive understanding of farce give 'I Love Lucy' an engaging lilt" wrote New York Times critic Jack Gould
In its Lucy cover story Time magazine said "This is the sort of cheerful rowdiness that has been rare
Tricked out as a ballerina or a Hindu maharani or a toothless hillbilly she takes her assorted lumps and pratfalls with unflagging zest and good humor"
In a 1981 interview in The Times even Miss Ball admitted "I love Lucy"
"She was always in financial trouble -- if she wanted a fur collar a ratty little fur collar she had to figure out a way to make some extra money to get it
An amazing 44 million viewers 90% of the television audience gleefully watched on Jan 19 1953 when she gave birth on film to the show's little Ricky
"I was so damned happy -- just floating on a cloud -- and I think the way I felt came across on the film" she said
Astoundingly or so it seems in retrospect early reviews of Miss Ball's talents gave little hint of what was to come
In fact when she was a plucky 15-year-old looking for that first break on Broadway Miss Ball was told by a drama teacher to give up
Born to an electrician father and pianist mother on Aug 6 1911 in a suburb of Jamestown NY Miss Ball had set her sights on stardom almost from the first
Each spring that followed she would head toward New York City walking until someone found her and returned her to her home
Leaving school at 15 Miss Ball finally made it to New York and the John Murray Anderson dramatic school
There was a brief stint in a Ziegfeld Follies road show and some short-lived appearances in a handful of Broadway chorus lines
Playing the ingenue lead in the 1940 musical "Too Many Girls" Miss Ball met rumba singer Arnaz cast as a Cuban football player
With Arnaz traveling the country with his band and Miss Ball committed to Hollywood sound stages the pair spent almost $30000 on telegrams and long-distance telephone calls
In 1967 with Desilu churning out a gold mine of televisions hits "Star Trek" and "Mission Impossible" among them an exhausted Miss Ball decided that she had had enough
