The Senate panel weighing John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary has found a substantial discrepancy in Tower's descriptions of his business dealings with a British aircraft and weapons manufacturer congressional sources said Friday
Tower testified last week that he had represented British Aerospace Inc only on civil aviation matters not as a consultant on military systems
But in a divorce deposition taken in June 1987 Tower stated that he had given the company advice on "selling certain systems to the Defense Department"
In the deposition Tower said he represented the firm on a range of military programs and was paid $8000 a month
Records show that the payments continued from June 1986 until December 1988
Also he served on the board of directors of the company the US subsidiary of British Aerospace PLC
The discrepancy sources said has prompted concerns about the veracity and completeness of Tower's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee the panel hearing testimony on his confirmation
And it raises the question of whether Tower should have registered as a lobbyist for foreign interests under the Foreign Agents Registration Act they said
Lawmakers from both parties have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of interest hanging over Tower because of his employment by weapons firms which brought him at least $760000 in 2 1/2 years -- not including the more than $200000 British Aerospace paid him
In his testimony Tower has described his lobbying and consulting work for a half-dozen US defense firms that do business with the Pentagon
The addition of the British firm to the list would add another -- and the first foreign-based firm -- whose interests could pose a potential conflict
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga) and other committee members are said to be troubled by these issues and have indicated that they may vote against Tower unless the apparent conflicts and questions are resolved
Around the same time he entered into lucrative consulting arrangements with major defense firms including Rockwell International Inc Textron Inc LTV Corp and Martin Marietta Corp
