Shortly after 2 pm Wednesday San Diego resident Mohammad Nyakoui got a call from his wife who is spending the summer in the Caspian Sea coastal city of Rasht Iran with her family
"I asked her what she was doing and she said she was watching the World Cup" Nyakoui recalls
About 15 minutes after she hung up Rasht and other cities in Iran's northern region were rocked by an earthquake that killed thousands
Back home in San Diego it was several hours before Nyakoui even heard news of the quake
When he did some quick time-zone arithmetic showed that he had talked to his wife just minutes before the quake happened
"I tried through the Red Cross to call Iran but they told us they couldn't do anything before 48 hours passed"
One of about 25000 San Diego Iranians in the same anxious state Nyakoui was luckier than most His wife managed to call him a second time that day about eight hours after the quake to tell him she and their two children were safe
It's just impossible to get through" said Houshang Ghashghai who teaches political science at San Diego State University
Hamid Biglari a theoretical physicist at UC San Diego was among those who organized a local group to gather contributions for the United Nations Fund for the Iran Earthquake
