Soviet President Mikhail S Gorbachev warned the nation Saturday night that the country's growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as threatening his program of political and economic reforms
Appealing for calm and for the cool consideration of grievances after weeks of continuing unrest in scattered areas of the country Gorbachev made clear the leadership's fear that the nation is heading into a political maelstrom that could tear the Soviet Union apart
As president Gorbachev said it is his "duty to warn you about the mounting danger of worsening inter-ethnic relations and the consequences for society for every family and for every person"
"The fate of perestroika and the unity of our state is at stake" he declared in a sober 20-minute address broadcast on radio and television "
Irresponsible slogans political instigation setting one national group against another the domination of some ethnic groups by others
With serious ethnic clashes in Soviet Central Asia over the past month with troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the Baltic republics of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania Gorbachev is struggling to hold the Soviet Union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes will resolve most of the grievances
Even as he spoke Soviet officials reported new violence in the south -- this time between Georgians and Azerbaijanis inside the Georgian republic but in an area with many Azerbaijanis
Roving gangs armed with hunting rifles gasoline bombs and other weapons had clashed in three towns south of the capital of Tbilisi last week leaving one man dead and 22 people seriously wounded
Of equal gravity for Gorbachev in domestic political terms has been the growth of not only nationalism but the appearance of secessionist groups in the Baltic republics and in Armenia Georgia and Moldavia a Soviet republic on the Romanian border
Although these questions will be dealt with during a special meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee in late July and then debated again by the Congress of People's Deputies the country's new national assembly Gorbachev apparently felt that he could not wait for those debates and he set out his own broad guidelines for dealing with the crisis
