Philippine Vice President and opposition leader Salvador H Laurel declined Saturday night to condemn the armed insurrection in his country and said the rebels "have the right" to try to seize power
Laurel also said that the rebels will not surrender to President Corazon Aquino's forces as she has demanded
He predicted that the fighting may turn to civil war if reported rebel reinforcements arrive from Cebu Mindanao and other islands
"I don't think this is going to end right away" he said in a suite in the Peninsula Hotel here
Laurel who is known as Doy broke with Aquino shortly after they took office in 1986 following a popular uprising that toppled former President Ferdinand E Marcos
Laurel said 18 Nacionalista leaders were meeting at the Intercontinental Hotel in Manila late Saturday despite the presence of rebel holdouts in the hotel
But Laurel said the US fighter-bombers destroyed a Philippine air force fuel dump and other facilities at Sangley Point and fired rockets that killed civilians near Camp Aguinaldo the armed forces headquarters
Laurel added that Aquino now is "completely beholden" to the United States just as exploratory talks on renegotiating leases for Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base the two largest US military facilities abroad are beginning
