Who would have thought that Snow White of all people would become the source of Oscar night's only major glitch
The Walt Disney Co filed suit in Los Angeles federal court Thursday against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences charging copyright infringement of its Snow White character and unfair competition
The famous fairy tale character portrayed by singer-dancer Eileen Bowman opened Wednesday night's Academy Awards ceremonies with an elaborate 10-minute song-and-dance routine
But Disney contends that the character was used on the show without the company's permission
"We have great respect for the academy and for all that it does" Frank Wells Disney's president and chief operating officer said Thursday in a prepared statement
"We were therefore greatly surprised and dismayed when we viewed last evening's Academy Awards ceremonies to see that our Snow White character had been used extensively without our permission"
The Snow White character -- as portrayed Wednesday night by Bowman -- was created by Steve Silver who for 15 years has used the character in the San Francisco musical revue "Beach Blanket Babylon"
