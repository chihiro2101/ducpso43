Their common ground pretty much ended when the miles of asphalt to the finish line did
By the time most people were starting their first cup of coffee Sunday morning Benjamin Paredez Martinez of Ecatepec Mexico and Kathy Smith of Newport Beach were crowned winners in the San Diego Marathon at the Oceanside pier efforts than earned them $2000 apiece
The runs set records on the new North County course but the times even helped by warm breezes and clear 74-degree conditions were hardly blistering
Martinez 29 finished in 2 hours 19 minutes 3 seconds 36 seconds faster than Doug Kurtis of Northville Mich
Smith's 24305 seemed days quicker than the 25212 posted by Escondido's Mindy Ireland
In years past the marathon's mystery often has been who the leader was not how he got there
Runners often from Mexico would register late and race officials were at their wits end when the media screamed to know the identity of the leader
They knew who Martinez was but no one was sure how he was able to practically appear out of nowhere to take the lead from Alfredo Rosas of San Pedro going into the 25-mile mark
Rosas and a pack of as many as eight came out at a pace seven to 10 seconds quicker per mile
After the 14-mile mark the pack has already thinned to just Rosas Danny Bustos Doug Kurtis and Ernesto Gutierrez who ran single file for a time
Martinez and Martin Rodriguez Rivera held back but Martinez soon heard a little voice that told him to move or be removed from contention
Since Martinez hadn't been seen earlier it originally was thought the figure gainly ground slowly but methodically from Mile 21 to Mile 24 was San Diego's Henry Chio
Martinez' late kick caught Rosas who had broken away on his own for a three-mile lead at Mile 21 cramped and been surprised at the 23-mile mark
Before Martinez took the lead for good -- a uphill surge at Mile 25 -- it appeared Rosas was hearing footsteps and was looking over his shoulder to see who was gaining on him
Martinez is a world-class biathlete who finished third at the World Duathlon Championship two weeks ago near Palm Springs
Having run with Ireland last year in the San Diego Marathon Smith knew a little of Ireland's racing style
